# PLDB Database Folder

PLDB uses a flat plain text database called <a href="https://treebase.treenotation.org/">TreeBase</a>.

This folder contains 2 subfolders:

1. `grammar/` - Contains the schema for the database.
2. `things/` - Contains all the actual entries in the database, one file for each entry.
