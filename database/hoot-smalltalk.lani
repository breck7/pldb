description Hoot is a variation of Smalltalk that integrates the best features of Smalltalk with those of a host language and its virtual machine VM. The initial target platforms include Java (and its JVM), and C# (and its CLR). Hoot is an experimental new programming language which builds on experience and understanding gained during the development of Bistro Smalltalk. Thus, Hoot Smalltalk is the natural and conceptual successor of Bistro Smalltalk.
