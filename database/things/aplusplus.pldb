 summary A++ stands for abstraction plus reference plus  synthesis which is used as a name for the minimalistic  programming language that is built on ARS. ARS is an abstraction from the Lambda Calculus, taking its three basic operations, and giving them a more general meaning, thus providing a foundation for the three major programming paradigms: functional programming, object-oriented programming and imperative programming. ARS Based Programming is used as a name for programming which consists mainly of applying patterns derived from ARS to programming in any language. The  technical texts in this article are taken from the online version of the 1st edition of the A++-book.The 2nd edition of the book A++ The Smallest Programming Language in the World (292 pages) was published in 2018.
