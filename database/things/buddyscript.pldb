 summary BuddyScript is a domain-specific language originally developed by ActiveBuddy. The main purpose of the language is to be able to process natural language queries and return results in natural language form. It was the core language for the SmarterChild and Windows Live Agents which were IM/Web based robots. As the Windows Live Agents SDK has been retired by Microsoft, the future of BuddyScript is uncertain. Like Python BuddyScript uses whitespace indentation to delimit blocks (also known as off-side rule).
