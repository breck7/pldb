 summary exFAT (Extended File Allocation Table) is a Microsoft file system introduced in 2006 and optimized for flash memory such as USB flash drives and SD cards. It is proprietary and Microsoft owns patents on several elements of its design.exFAT can be used where NTFS is not a feasible solution (due to data-structure overhead), but a greater file-size limit than the standard FAT32 file system (i.e. 4 GiB) is required. exFAT has been adopted by the SD Card Association as the default file system for SDXC cards larger than 32 GiB.
