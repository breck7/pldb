 summary SPIP (Système de Publication pour l'Internet) is a free software content management system designed for web site publishing, oriented towards online collaborative editing. The software is designed for easy setup, use and maintenance, and is used in public and private institutions. The last P in the word SPIP stands for both Partagé (shared) and Participatif (participative), in the sense that the software is designed for collective online editing. Its mascot is a flying squirrel. It is used both by institutional sites, community portals, academic sites, personal webpages, and news sites.
