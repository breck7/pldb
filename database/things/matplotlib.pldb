  >>> from matplotlib import cm
  >>> from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D
  >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  >>> import numpy as np
  >>> fig = plt.figure()
  >>> ax = fig.gca(projection='3d')
  >>> X = np.arange(-5, 5, 0.25)
  >>> Y = np.arange(-5, 5, 0.25)
  >>> X, Y = np.meshgrid(X, Y)
  >>> R = np.sqrt(X**2 + Y**2)
  >>> Z = np.sin(R)
  >>> surf = ax.plot_surface(X, Y, Z, rstride=1, cstride=1, cmap=cm.coolwarm)
  >>> plt.show()

 summary matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK+. There is also a procedural "pylab" interface based on a state machine (like OpenGL), designed to closely resemble that of MATLAB, though its use is discouraged. SciPy makes use of matplotlib. matplotlib was originally written by John D. Hunter, has an active development community, and is distributed under a BSD-style license. Michael Droettboom was nominated as matplotlib's lead developer shortly before John Hunter's death in 2012. As of 23 June 2017, matplotlib 2.0.x supports Python versions 2.7 through 3.6. Matplotlib 1.2 is the first version of matplotlib to support Python 3.x. Matplotlib 1.4 is the last version of matplotlib to support Python 2.6.
