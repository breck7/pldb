description Kona is the open-source implementation of the k3 programming language. k is a synthesis of APL and LISP. Although many of the capabilities come from APL, the fundamental data construct is quite different. In APL the construct is a multi-dimensional matrix-like array, where the dimension of the array can range from 0 to some maximum (often 9). In k, like LISP, the fundamental data construct is a list. Also, like LISP, the k language is ASCII-based, so you don't need a special keyboard.

example
 factorial:{*/1+!:x}
 fib1:{(x(|+\)\1 1)[;1]}
 fib2:{x{x,+/-2#x}/!2}
 fib_rec:{:[x<2;1;_f[x-1]+_f[x-2]]}
 maxsubsum:{|/0(0|+)\x}
 primes_to_n_sieve:{2_&{:[x@y;x&@[1,-1_ z#(1_ y#1),0;y;:;1];x]}/[x#1;2_!__ceil_sqrt x;x]}
 primes_to_n_sieve2:{:[x<4;,2;r,1_&~|/x#'~!:'r: _f[_ _ceil _sqrt x]]}
