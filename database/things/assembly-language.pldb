 summary An assembly (or assembler) language, often abbreviated asm, is any low-level programming language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the program's statements and the architecture's machine code instructions.Each assembly language is specific to a particular computer architecture and operating system. In contrast, most high-level programming languages are generally portable across multiple architectures but require interpreting or compiling. Assembly language may also be called symbolic machine code.Assembly language usually has one statement per machine instruction, but assembler directives, macros and symbolic labels of program and memory locations are often also supported. Assembly code is converted into executable machine code by a utility program referred to as an assembler. The conversion process is referred to as assembly, or assembling the source code.
