 summary NWScript is the scripting language developed by BioWare for the role-playing video game Neverwinter Nights. It is based on the C programming language and is implemented in the Aurora toolset. Neverscript, an open source 3rd party editor, has been created for the Mac OS X and Linux versions of NWN because the Aurora toolset has not been ported to those platforms. NWScript is also used in the video games The Witcher, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II The Sith Lords, which use the Odyssey Engine. Neverwinter Nights 2, the sequel to the original NWN, features a modified version of this scripting language.
