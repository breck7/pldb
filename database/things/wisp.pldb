  ;; # wisp
  
  ; Wisp is homoiconic JS dialect with a clojure syntax, s-expressions and
  ; macros. Wisp code compiles to a human readable javascript, which is one
  ; of they key differences from clojurescript.
  
  ;; ## wisp data structures
  
  ;; 1. nil - is just like js undefined with a differenc that it's
  ;;    not something can be defined. In fact it's just a shortcut for
  ;;    void(0) in JS.
  nil ;; => void(0)
  
  ;; 2. Booleans - Wisp booleans true / false are JS booleans
  
  true ;; => true
  
  ;; 3. Numbers - Wisp numbers are JS numbers
  1  ;; => 1
  
  ;; 4. Strings - Wisp strings are JS Strings
  "Hello world"
  ;;    Wisp strings can be multiline
  "Hello,
  My name is wisp!"
  
  ;; 5. Characters - Characters are sugar for JS single char strings
  \a  ;; => "a"
  
  ;; 6. Keywords - Keywords are symbolic identifiers that evaluate to
  ;;               themselves.
  :keyword  ;; => "keyword"
  ;;    Since in JS string constats fulfill this purpose of symbolic
  ;;    identifiers, keywords compile to equivalent JS strings.
  (window.addEventListener :load handler false)
  ;;    Keywords can be invoked as functions, that desugars to plain
  ;;    associated value access in JS
  (:bar foo) ;; => foo["bar"]
  
  
  ;; 7. Vectors - Wisp vectors are JS arrays.
  [ 1 2 3 4 ]
  ;;    Note: Commas are white space & can be used if desired
  [ 1, 2, 3, 4]
  
  
  ;; 8. Maps - Maps are hash maps, plain JS objects. Note that unlike
  ;;    in clojure keys can not be of arbitary types.
  { "foo" bar :beep-bop "bop" 1 2 }
  ;;    Commas are optional but can come handy for separating key value
  ;;    pairs.
  { a 1, b 2 }
  ;; In a future JSONs syntax may be made compatible with map syntax.
  
  
  ;; 9. Lists - You can't have a lisp without lists! Wisp has lists too.
  ;;    Wisp is homoiconic and it's code is made up of lists representing
  ;;    expressions. The first item in the expression is a function, being
  ;;    invoked with rest items as arguments.
  (foo bar baz) ; => foo(bar, baz);
  
  ;; # Conventions
  ;; Wisp puts a lot of effort in making naming conventions tra
