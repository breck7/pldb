 summary KonsolScript is a cross-platform scripting language used mostly for games. It is available for Windows and Linux Operating Systems. KonsolScript was developed during 2005 as the scripting language which is intentionally  for the purpose writing games with KAGE (Alternative Game Engine). However, its interpreter, Quixie, can also be used as common gateway interface for serving web pages. KonsolScript's language design is greatly inspired by C programming language and VergeC, although its drawing API is inspired by ActionScript. Together with KAGE, KonsolScript was distributed as freeware until it was released as free software in SourceForge on April 2006. KonsolScript is licensed under GNU General Public License.
