 summary Omnis Studio is a rapid application development (RAD) tool that allows programmers and application developers to create enterprise, web, and mobile applications for Windows, Linux, and macOS personal computers and servers across all business sectors. The Omnis JavaScript Client allows developers to build all types of web applications and mobile applications by presenting a highly functional interface in the user's desktop web browser, or on tablet and mobile devices. The business logic and database access in such web and mobile applications is handled by the Omnis server. The Omnis server also can act as a hub between database servers, services based on Java and .Net and clients like Adobe Air & Flex transferring data in the form of XML or Web services.
