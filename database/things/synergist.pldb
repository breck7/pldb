description The Synergist language was created by a crew out of Michigan (USA) somewhere around 1986 or 1987. A guy named Kingsbury (can't remember his first name,  but he's the brother of Digital Equipment Corporation guru Dan Kingsbury at https://networkingdynamics.com), was one of the principals in the group. Work on the project stopped by 1990.
