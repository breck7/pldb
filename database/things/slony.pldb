 summary Slony-I is an asynchronous master-slave replication system for the PostgreSQL DBMS, providing support for cascading and failover. Asynchronous means that when a database transaction has been committed to the master server, it is not yet guaranteed to be available in slaves. Cascading means that replicas can be created (and updated) via other replicas, i.e. they needn't directly connect to the master.
