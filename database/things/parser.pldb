 summary Parser is a free server-side CGI web scripting language developed by Art. Lebedev Studio and released under the GPL. Originally, Parser was merely a simple macro processing language. The latest 3rd revision (March 2006) introduced object-oriented programming features. The compiler for the language was developed in C++ by studio employees Konstantin Morshnev and Alexander Petrosyan to automate often repeated tasks, especially maintenance of already existing websites. It was used in many web projects of the studio. Since revision 3 it was released as free software and it is now used in other websites, mostly in Russia (according to a partial list at the language's website). The language supports technologies needed for common web design tasks: XML, Document Object Model (DOM), Perl Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE) and others.
