 summary BASIC Programming (Model# CX2620) is an Atari 2600 cartridge that teaches simple computer programming. It was released in 1979 and was one of only a few non-gaming cartridges designed for the console. The programming language is similar to dialects of BASIC. The Atari 2600's RAM size of 128 bytes restricts the possibilities for writing programs.
