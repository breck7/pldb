 example
  The name "git" was given by Linus Torvalds when he wrote the very
  first version. He described the tool as "the stupid content tracker"
  and the name as (depending on your way):
  
   - random three-letter combination that is pronounceable, and not actually used by any common UNIX command. The fact that it is a mispronunciation of "get" may or may not be relevant.
   - stupid. contemptible and despicable. simple. Take your pick from the dictionary of slang.
   - "global information tracker": you're in a good mood, and it actually works for you. Angels sing, and a light suddenly fills the room.
   - "goddamn idiotic truckload of shit": when it breaks

 summary Git () is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for source code management in software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files. As a distributed revision control system it is aimed at speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development. Its current maintainer since 2005 is Junio Hamano. As with most other distributed version control systems, and unlike most clientâ€“server systems, every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server. Git is free software distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2.
