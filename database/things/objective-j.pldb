 summary Objective-J is a programming language developed as part of the Cappuccino web development framework. Its syntax is nearly identical to the Objective-C syntax and it shares with JavaScript the same relationship that Objective-C has with the C programming language: that of being a strict, but small, superset; adding traditional inheritance and Smalltalk/Objective-C style dynamic dispatch. Pure JavaScript, being a prototype-based language, already has a notion of object orientation and inheritance, but Objective-J adds the use of class-based programming to JavaScript. Programs written in Objective-J need to be preprocessed before being run by a web browser's JavaScript virtual machine. This step can occur in the web browser at runtime or by a compiler which translates Objective-J programs into pure JavaScript code.  The Objective-J compiler is written in JavaScript; consequently, deploying Objective-J programs does not require a web browser plug-in. Objective-J can be compiled and run on Node.js.
