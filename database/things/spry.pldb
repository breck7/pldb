description Spry borrows homoiconicity from Rebol and Lisp, free form syntax from Forth and Rebol, the word of different types from Rebol, good data structure literal support from JavaScript and the general coding experience and style from Smalltalk. It also has a few ideas of its own, like an interesting argument passing mechanism and a relatively novel take on OO.

example
 # Let's add a method to:do: that works as in Smalltalk.
 # Methods take the first argument, the "receiver", from the left
 # and binds it to "self".
 to:do: = method [:to :block
   n = self
   [n <= to] whileTrue: [
     do block n
     ..n = (n + 1)]]
 
 # Then we can loop in Smalltalk style echoing 1 to 5!
 1 to: 5 do: [echo :x]
 
 # We can similarly implement select: from Smalltalk
 select: = method [:pred
   result = ([] clone)
   self reset
   [self end?] whileFalse: [
     n = (self next)
     do pred n then: [result add: n]]
   ^result]
 
 # Then use it to produce [3 4]
 echo ([1 2 3 4] select: [:x > 2])
