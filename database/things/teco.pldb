 summary TECO (; originally an acronym for [paper] Tape editor and corrector, but later Text editor and corrector, then Text editor character oriented) is a text editor originally developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the 1960s, after which it was modified by many other people. TECO was a direct ancestor of Emacs, which was originally implemented in TECO macros.
