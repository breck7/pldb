  def fib():
      a, b = 0L, 1L       # The 'L's make the numbers double word length (typically 64 bits)
      while true:
          yield b
          a, b = b, a + b
  
  # Print the first 5 numbers in the series:
  for index as int, element in zip(range(5), fib()):
      print("${index+1}: ${element}")

 summary Boo is an object-oriented, statically typed, general-purpose programming language that seeks to make use of the Common Language Infrastructure's support for Unicode, internationalization, and web applications, while using a Python-inspired syntax and a special focus on language and compiler extensibility. Some features of note include type inference, generators, multimethods, optional duck typing, macros, true closures, currying, and first-class functions. Boo was one of the three scripting languages for the Unity game engine (Unity Technologies employed De Oliveira), until it was dropped in 2014 due to small userbase. Boo is free software released under the BSD 3-Clause license. It is compatible with both the Microsoft .NET and Mono frameworks.
