 summary S3 is a structured, imperative high-level computer programming language.  It was developed by the UK company International Computers Limited (ICL) for its 2900 Series mainframes. It is a system programming language with syntax influenced by ALGOL 68 but with data types and operators aligned to those offered by the 2900 Series.  It was the implementation language of the operating system VME.
