title ALPAK
appeared 1963
type pl
description This is the first of two papers on the ALPAK system for nonnumerical algebra on a digital computer. This paper is concerned with polynomials in several variables and truncated power series with polynomial coefficients. The second paper will discuss rational functions of several variables, truncated, power series with rational-function coefficients, and syste7ns of linear equations with rational-function coefficients. The ALPAK system has been programmed within the BE-S YS-4 monitor system on the IBM 7090 computer, but the language and concepts are machine independent.
