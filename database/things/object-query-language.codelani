 summary Object Query Language (OQL) is a query language standard for object-oriented databases modeled after SQL.  OQL was developed by the Object Data Management Group (ODMG). Because of its overall complexity nobody has ever fully implemented the complete OQL. OQL has influenced the design of some of the newer query languages like JDOQL and EJB QL, but they can't be considered as different flavors of OQL.
