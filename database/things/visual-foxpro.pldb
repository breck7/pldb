 summary Visual FoxPro is a discontinued data-centric, object-oriented, procedural, programming language produced by Microsoft. It was derived from FoxPro (originally known as FoxBASE) which was developed by Fox Software beginning in 1984. It contained the fastest PC-based database engine available at the time. Fox Technologies merged with Microsoft in 1992, after which the software acquired further features and the prefix "Visual". The database engine is more powerful than the Microsoft Jet Database Engine which is used by Microsoft Access. FoxPro 2.6 worked on Mac OS, DOS, Windows, and Unix. Visual FoxPro 3.0, the first "Visual" version, reduced platform support to only Mac and Windows, and later versions 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 were Windows-only. The current version of Visual FoxPro is COM-based and Microsoft has stated that they do not intend to create a Microsoft .NET version. Version 9.0, released in 2004 and updated in 2007, is the final version of the product.
