  Documentation     Example test case using the gherkin syntax.
  ...
  ...               This test has a workflow similar to the keyword-driven
  ...               examples. The difference is that the keywords use higher
  ...               abstraction level and their arguments are embedded into
  ...               the keyword names.
  ...
  ...               This kind of _gherkin_ syntax has been made popular by
  ...               [http://cukes.info|Cucumber]. It works well especially when
  ...               tests act as examples that need to be easily understood also
  ...               by the business people.
