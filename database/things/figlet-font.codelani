  Ivrit (Hebrew) Unicode font assembled by John Cowan <cowan@ccil.org>
  Latin chars from  Standard by G. Chappell & Ian Chai
  Hebrew chars from Jerusalem by Gedaliah Friedenberg <gfrieden@nyx.cs.du.edu>
          Use "ilhebrew.flc" for Hebrew keyboard mapping
          Use "ushebrew.flc" for U.S.-style keyboard mapping ("febrew" script)
          Use "8859-8.flc" for ISO 8859-8 text
          Or use UTF-8
  WARNING! FIGfonts aren't bidirectional; this is strictly right-to-left 
          (by default) even for the Latin characters.
  figlet release 2.2 -- November 1996
  
  Modified by Paul Burton <solution@earthlink.net> 12/96 to include new parameter
  supported by FIGlet and FIGWin.  May also be slightly modified for better use
  of new full-width/kern/smush alternatives, but default output is NOT changed.
