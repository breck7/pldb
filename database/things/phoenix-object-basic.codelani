 summary Phoenix Object Basic is an object-oriented rapid application development tool for Linux. It has object-oriented features such as inheritance and polymorphism as found in languages such as Python and Perl. It also features a similar design environment and compatible syntax to Visual Basic reducing the learning curve for those making a transition from that language to Linux programming. Phoenix includes a full implementation of the BASIC programming language. It was released for download in 2001 and the Linux package is at version 1.5 beta 6 (released October 2004), it also requires the distribution of a small number of runtime library files with complied applications. Phoenix Object Basic is a proprietary tool for cross-platform Linux and Windows application development.
