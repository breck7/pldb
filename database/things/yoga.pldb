description Yoga is purely functional, meaning that every function takes inputs and returns outputs, without any side effects. Yoga programs have an implicit main loop, which is run every time a hardware sensor reports new values. It then propagates updates through the program like a spreadsheet. Yoga’s lexical syntax is close enough to JavaScript that you can use JavaScript syntax highlighting in your editor.
