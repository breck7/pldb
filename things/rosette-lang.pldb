description Rosette is a solver-aided programming language that extends Racket with language constructs for program synthesis, verification, and more. To verify or synthesize code, Rosette compiles it to logical constraints solved with off-the-shelf SMT solvers. By combining virtualized access to solvers with Racket’s metaprogramming, Rosette makes it easy to develop synthesis and verification tools for new languages.

 #lang rosette
 
 (define (interpret formula)

     [`(¬ ,expr)     (! (interpret expr))]
     [lit            (constant lit boolean?)]))
 
 ; This implements a SAT solver.

   (solve (assert (interpret formula))))
 
 (SAT `(∧ r o (∨ s e (¬ t)) t (¬ e)))
