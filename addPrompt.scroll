PLDB is a Programming Language DataBase.

It contains a single file about every language, and other important inventions in computing.

The data is written in the PPS stack (Particle Syntax, Parsers, and Scroll).

The code for the Parsers is listed below. And then I gave 4 example files.

codeFromFile code/measures.parsers
codeFromFile concepts/elixir.scroll
codeFromFile concepts/c.scroll
codeFromFile concepts/markdown.scroll
codeFromFile concepts/parsers.scroll
