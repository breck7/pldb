Nios II is a 32-bit embedded-processor architecture designed specifically for the Altera family of FPGAs. Nios II incorporates many enhancements over the original Nios architecture, making it more suitable for a wider range of embedded computing applications, from DSP to system-control. Nios II is comparable to MicroBlaze, a competing softcore CPU for the Xilinx family of FPGA. Read more on Wikipedia...
