The Cedar language is a programming language derived from Mesa, which in turn is derived from Pascal. It is meant to be used for a wide variety of programming tasks, ranging from low level systems software to large applications. In addition to the sequential control constructs, static type checking and structured types of Pascal, and the modules, exception handling, and concurrency control constructs of Mesa, Cedar also has garbage collection, dynamic types, and a limited form of type parameterization.
