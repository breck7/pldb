 summary Sequence Alignment Map (SAM) is a text-based format for storing biological sequences aligned to a reference sequence developed by Heng Li and Bob Handsaker et al. It is widely used for storing data, such as nucleotide sequences, generated by next generation sequencing technologies. The format supports short and long reads (up to 128Mbp) produced by different sequencing platforms and is used to hold mapped data within the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) and across the Broad Institute, the Wellcome Sanger Institute, and throughout the 1000 Genomes Project. Sequence Alignment/Map (SAM) format for alignment of nucleotide sequences (e.g. sequencing reads) to (a) reference sequence(s). May contain base-call and alignment qualities and other data.
