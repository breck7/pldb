description The IEEE 1076.1 language, a hardware description language for the description and the simulation of analog, digital, and mixed-signal systems, is defined in this standard. The language, also informally known as VHDL-AMS, is built on IEEE Std 1076-2008 (VHDL) and extends it with additions and changes to provide capabilities of writing and simulating analog and mixed-signal models.

 summary VHDL-AMS is a derivative of the hardware description language VHDL (IEEE standard 1076-1993). It includes analog and mixed-signal extensions (AMS) in order to define the behavior of analog and mixed-signal systems (IEEE 1076.1-1999). The VHDL-AMS standard was created with the intent of enabling designers of analog and mixed signal systems and integrated circuits to create and use modules that encapsulate high-level behavioral descriptions as well as structural descriptions of systems and components.VHDL-AMS is an industry standard modeling language for mixed signal circuits. It provides both continuous-time and event-driven modeling semantics, and so is suitable for analog, digital, and mixed analog/digital circuits. It is particularly well suited for verification of very complex analog, mixed-signal and radio frequency integrated circuits.
