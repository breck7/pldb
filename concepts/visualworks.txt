VisualWorks is a cross-platform implementation of the Smalltalk language. It is implemented as a development system based on "images", which are dynamic collections of software objects, each contained in a system image. The lineage of VisualWorks goes back to the first Smalltalk-80 implementation by Xerox PARC. Read more on Wikipedia...
