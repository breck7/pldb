OBJ is a programming language family introduced by Joseph Goguen in 1976. It is a family of declarative "ultra high-level" languages. It features abstract types, generic modules, subsorts (subtypes with multiple inheritance), pattern-matching modulo equations, E-strategies (user control over laziness), module expressions (for combining modules), theories and views (for describing module interfaces) for the massively parallel RRM (rewrite rule machine).
