SYMPL is an obsolete programming language developed by the Control Data Corporation (CDC) for use on the CDC 6000 series computer systems in the 1970s and 1980s.  It was based on a subset of CDCs version of JOVIAL, as an alternative to assembly language.  A number of important CDC software products were implemented in SYMPL, including compilers, libraries, a full-screen editor, and major subsystems. Read more on Wikipedia...
