Charity is an experimental purely functional programming language, developed at the University of Calgary under the supervision of Robin Cockett. Based on ideas by Hagino Tatsuya, it is completely grounded in category theory. Disregarding interactions with the outside world, all Charity programs are guaranteed to terminate or stay productive.
