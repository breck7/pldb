Pizza is an open-source superset of Java 1.4, prior to the introduction of generics for the Java programming language.  In addition to its own solution for adding generics to the language, Pizza also added function pointers and algebraic types with case classes and pattern matching. In August 2001, the developers made a compiler capable of working with Java. Read more on Wikipedia...
