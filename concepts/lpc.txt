LPC (short for Lars Pensjö C) is an object-oriented programming language derived from C and developed originally by Lars Pensjö to facilitate MUD building on LPMuds. Though designed for game development, its flexibility has led to it being used for a variety of purposes, and to its evolution into the language Pike. LPC syntax places it in the family of C-like languages, with C and C++ its strongest influences.. Read more on Wikipedia...
