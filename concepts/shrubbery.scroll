description Shrubbery notation is a set of text-level conventions that build toward a full programming language, such as Rhombus. The notation is line- and indentation-sensitive, and it is intended to partially group input, but leave further parsing to another layer, especially enforestation. The parsed form of a shrubbery imposes grouping to ensure that further parsing is consistent with the shrubberyâ€™s lines and indentation.

example
 block:
   println("group within block")
   println("another group within block")
 
 if is_rotten(apple)
 | get_another()
 | take_bite()
   be_happy()
 
 match x
 | 0:
     let zero = x
     x + zero
 | n:
     n + 1
 
 cond
 | // check the weather
   is_raining():
     take_umbrella()
 | // check the destination
   going_to_beach():
     wear_sunscreen()
     take_umbrella()
 | // assume a hat is enough
   ~else:
     wear_hat()
