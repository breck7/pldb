 summary Dink Smallwood is an action role-playing video game, developed by Robinson Technologies, at the time consisting of Seth Robinson, Justin Martin, and Greg Smith. It was first released in 1998 before being released as freeware on October 17, 1999. Mitch Brink composed several of the game's music tracks, while others are MIDI forms of classical music, such as Debussy's "Reverie". The game has a small but constant fan following that continues to develop add-ons for the game more than a decade after its release. The game is also notable for its humorous dialogue and surrealistic themes in various scenes between the gameplay.
