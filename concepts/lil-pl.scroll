description Lil is part of the technology that powers Decker, a multimedia creative tool inspired by HyperCard. Decker uses Lil for adding custom behavior to decks and the widgets within. Lil is designed to be learned in layers, but it is a richly multi-paradigm language which incorporates ideas from imperative, functional, declarative, and vector-oriented languages.
