 summary Handel-C is a high-level programming language which targets low-level hardware, most commonly used in the programming of FPGAs. It is a rich subset of C, with non-standard extensions to control hardware instantiation with an emphasis on parallelism.  Handel-C is to hardware design what the first high-level programming languages were to programming CPUs.  Unlike many other design languages that target a specific architecture Handel-C can be compiled to a number of design languages and then synthesised to the corresponding hardware.  This frees developers to concentrate on the programming task at hand rather than the idiosyncrasies of a specific design language and architecture.
