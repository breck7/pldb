SAM76 is a macro programming language used from the late 1970s to the present 2007 initially ran on CP/M. The SAM76 language is a list and string processor designed for interactive and user-directed applications, including artificial intelligence programming, and permits high portability from machine to machine. The language shares certain features in common with LISP, Forth, and shell programming languages of the UNIX operating system. Read more on Wikipedia...
