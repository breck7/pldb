    ## Slashdown is a superset of markdown.

    Using indentation and some simple syntax, you can hand write markup with more customizability and *dare I say* OOOMPH!

    It was designed for [HTMX](), [Tailwind](), and joy. In fact, this page has Tailwind&#39;s PlayCDN enabled â€“ go to town experimenting!

    ## The basics

    ### Any line that starts with a `/` is a tag.
    By default, it will render a div, but you can name it anything you want: `/section`, `/MyComponent`, `/x-thing`.

    ### Attributes can follow:
    `/button hx-post=&quot;/clicked&quot; hx-swap=&quot;outerHTML&quot;`

    #### Common shorthands for classes and IDs:
    `/section #hero .rounded.bg-gray-200.p-4`

    #### Stacking, for organization

    ### Text at the end
    At the end of a tag, you can add ` = ` followed by anything except line breaks. This will be treated as innerText for that tag.
    `/section #hero .rounded.bg-gray-200.p-4`
