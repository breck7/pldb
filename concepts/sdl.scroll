description The authors are currently evaluating the use of shared dataspace paradigm as the basis for a novel programming language, called SDL (Shared Dataspace Language), that supports large-scale concurrency. Their goal is to develop the software support needed for the design, analysis, understanding, and testing of programs involving many thousands of concurrent processes running on a highly parallel multiprocessor. The authors provide an overview of the key SDL features, using small examples to illustrate its power and flexibility
