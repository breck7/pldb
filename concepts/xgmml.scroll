 summary XGMML (the eXtensible Graph Markup and Modeling Language) is an XML application based on GML which is used for graph description. Technically, while GML is not related to XML nor SGML, XGMML is an XML application that is so designed that there's a 1:1 relation towards GML for trivial conversion between the two formats.
