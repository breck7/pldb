Git () is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for source code management in software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files. As a distributed revision control system it is aimed at speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. Read more on Wikipedia...

The name &quot;git&quot; was given by Linus Torvalds when he wrote the very
first version. He described the tool as &quot;the stupid content tracker&quot;
and the name as (depending on your way):

 - random three-letter combination that is pronounceable, and not actually used by any common UNIX command. The fact that it is a mispronunciation of &quot;get&quot; may or may not be relevant.
 - stupid. contemptible and despicable. simple. Take your pick from the dictionary of slang.
 - &quot;global information tracker&quot;: you&#39;re in a good mood, and it actually works for you. Angels sing, and a light suddenly fills the room.
 - &quot;goddamn idiotic truckload of shit&quot;: when it breaks
