HotDog is an HTML editor developed by Sausage Software in the mid-1990s. At the time of its development, there were only a small number of HTML editors available on the market (such as HoTMetaL) and HotDog gathered significant interest due to its ease of use. The program was developed by the New Zealand Internet entrepreneur Steve Outtrim. Read more on Wikipedia...
