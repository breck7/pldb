description The Relational Model is a mathematical framework for organizing and managing data in databases using tables (relations), where data is stored in rows (tuples) and columns (attributes). It introduced the concept of relational algebra and provided a formal basis for querying and manipulating data, forming the foundation for modern relational database management systems (RDBMS).
