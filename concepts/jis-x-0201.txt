JIS X 0201, a Japanese Industrial Standard developed in 1969 (then called JIS C 6220 until the JIS category reform), was the first Japanese electronic character set to become widely used.  It is either 7-bit encoding or 8-bit encoding, although 8-bit encoding is dominant for modern use. The full name of this standard is 7-bit and 8-bit coded character sets for information interchange (7ビット及び8ビットの情報交換用符号化文字集合). Read more on Wikipedia...
