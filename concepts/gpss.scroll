 summary General Purpose Simulation System (GPSS) is a discrete time simulation general-purpose programming language, where a simulation clock advances in discrete steps. A system is modelled as transactions enter the system and are passed from one service (represented by blocks) to another. It is used primarily as a process flow oriented simulation language; this is particularly well-suited for problems such as a factory.
