# Hello, world!
&quot;Hello, world!&quot;.puts()

# Assignment
number = 42
opposite = true

# Conditions
number = -42 if opposite

# Lists (stored as immutable singly-linked lists)
list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Tuples (think of them as immutable arrays)
tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# Atoms (known as symbols to Ruby people)
# Think of them as an open-ended enumeration
atom = :up_and_atom

# Dicts (also known as hashes to Ruby people)
dict = {:foo =&gt; 1, :bar =&gt; 2, :baz =&gt; 3}

# Strings (unlike Erlang, Reia has a real String type!)
string = &quot;I&#39;m a string! Woohoo I&#39;m a string! #{&#39;And I interpolate too!&#39;}&quot;

# Ranges
range = 0..42

# Funs (anonymous functions, a.k.a. lambdas, procs, closures, etc.)
# Calling me with plustwo(40) would return 42
plustwo = fun(n) { n + 2 }

# Modules (collections of functions)
# Calling Plusser.addtwo(40) would return 42
module Plusser
  def addtwo(n)
    n + 2
  end
end

# Classes (of immutable objects. Once created objects can&#39;t be changed!)
class Adder
  # Reia supports binding instance variables directly when they&#39;re passed
  # as arguments to initialize
  def initialize(@n); end

  def plus(n)
    @n + n
  end
end

# Instantiate classes by calling Classname(arg1, arg2, ...)
# For you Ruby people who want Classname.new(...) this is coming soon!
fortytwo = Adder(40).plus(2)

# Function references can be obtained by omitting parens from a function call,
# like JavaScript or Python
numbers = [1,2,3]
reverser = [1,2,3].reverse

# Function references can be invoked just like lambdas
reversed = reverser() # reversed is now [3,2,1]

# You can add a ! to the end of any method to rebind the method receiver to
# the return value of the given method minus the bang.
numbers.reverse!() # numbers is now [3,2,1]

# List comprehensions
doubled = [n * 2 for n in numbers] # doubled is [6,4,2]
