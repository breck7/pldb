 summary Southampton BASIC System (SOBS) was a dialect of the BASIC programming language developed for and used on ICT 1900 series computers in the late 1960s and early 1970s; it was implemented under the MINIMOP operating system at the University of Southampton and also ran under MAXIMOP. It was operated from a Teletype terminal, though CRT terminals could also be used.
