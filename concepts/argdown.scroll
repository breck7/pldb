  # Welcome to Argdown!
 
  [Intro]: Argdown is a simple syntax for defining argumentative
  structures, inspired by Markdown.
    + Writing a *pro & contra list* in Argdown is as
      simple as writing a twitter message (actually we are
      right in the middle of one).
    + But you can also
      **logically reconstruct** more complex dialectical
      relations between arguments or dive into
      the details of their premise-conclusion structures.
    + Finally, you can export Argdown as a graph and create
      **argument maps** of whole debates.
 
  This Argdown document only demonstrates the basic syntax elements.
  The argument map produced is a "bogus debate".
 
  To read a reconstruction of a *real* debate, select one of the
  **example debates** by moving your mouse to the *"Examples"* button
  on the upper left, above the text editor.
 
  ## Argdown Basics
 
  This is a normal statement with __bold__ and _italic_ text,
  a #tag and a [link](https://github.com/christianvoigt/argdown-parser).
 
  [Statement 1]: Another statement (after a blank line),
  this time with a title defined in square brackets.
  We can use the title to refer to this statement later
  or mention it in other statements. #(Another tag)
 
  [Statement 2]: Let's do that now: The previous
  statement was @[Statement 1].
    + <Argument title>: Statements can be supported
      by __arguments__. Arguments are defined by
      using angle brackets. #tag
    - <Another argument>: This arguments attacks @[Statement 2]. #tag
      - <Yet another argument>: Arguments can also
        be supported or attacked. #yet-another-tag
        <!--
        By the way,
        this is a multiline comment.
        -->
 
  We can also do that the other way around:
 
  [Intro]
    -> <Argument 1>
 
  Headings can be used to group arguments and statements together.
  In the map these groups are visualized as grey boxes.
 
  Tags are visualized by the colors of the arguments and statements in the map.
 
  ### Argument reconstructions
 
  So far, we have ignored the internal structure of arguments. Arguments
  consist of premises from which conclusions are inferred. We can precisely
  define this premise-conclusion structure with Argdown:
 
  <Argument 1>
 
  (1) First premise (this is is a normal statement
      and you can do everything with it, we have done
      with the statements above).
  (2) [Statement 2]: We have already defined a statement
      with this title.
      Argdown allows you to add multiple statements
      to the same "equivalence class" by giving them
      the same title. The statements will then be treated
      as logically equivalent.
  --
  Some inference rule (Some additional info: 1,2)
  --
  (3) And now the conclusion
    -> Outgoing relations of the conclusion,
    are also interpreted as outgoing relations of
    the whole argument.
    +> <Yet another argument>
    <!--
    The second relation is only "sketched",
    because it does not declare which premise
    of @<Argument 2> is supported.
    (At this point this is not possible,
    as we have not yet reconstructed @<Argument 2>)
    -->
    -> [Statement 1]
 
    We can also link to headings:
