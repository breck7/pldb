Interchange File Format (IFF), is a generic container file format originally introduced by the Electronic Arts company in 1985 (in cooperation with Commodore) in order to facilitate transfer of data between software produced by different companies. IFF files do not have any standard extension.  On many systems that generate IFF files, file extensions are not important (the OS stores file format metadata separately from the file name).
