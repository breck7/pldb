 summary FACT is an early discontinued computer programming language, created by the Datamatic Division of Minneapolis Honeywell for its model 800 series business computers in 1959.  FACT was an acronym for "Fully Automated Compiling Technique".  It was an influence on the design of the COBOL programming language. Some of the design of FACT was based on the linguistic project Basic English, developed about 1925 by C.K. Ogden. The software was actually designed by Computer Sciences Corporation (Fletcher Jones, Roy Nutt, and Robert L. Patrick) under contract to Richard Clippinger of Honeywell.
