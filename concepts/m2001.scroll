 summary M2001 is a modular educational mathematical programming language for developing and presenting mathematical algorithms, from the modern discrete to the classical continuous mathematics. M2001 is built on a semantic framework that is based in category theory and has a syntax similar to that of Pascal or Modula-2. It is designed purely for pedagogic use, so efficiency and ease of implementation have been far less important in its development than generality and range of application. It was created to play an important role in forming a formal algorithmic foundation for first-year college math students.
