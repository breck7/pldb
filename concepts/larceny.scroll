 summary Larceny is an implementation of the Scheme programming language built around the Twobit optimizing compiler. Larceny offers several back-ends able to target native x86 and ARMv7 code.  Petit Larceny is also available and emits C source code, which can then be further compiled to native code with an ordinary C compiler.Older versions (<0.98) included support for the SPARC architecture in Larceny, and for Microsoft's Common Language Runtime via Common Larceny.Larceny supports all major Scheme standards (R5RS, IEEE/ANSI, R6RS, and R7RS.  The Larceny software is open source and available online.
