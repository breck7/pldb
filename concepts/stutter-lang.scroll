example
 let ratio be a Number and set it to 0.37
 let variable be a Number
 set variable to 5
 
 comment add is a method on the Number data type
 add 12.0 to variable
 
 comment all methods accept multiple parameters via the and conjunction
 multiply variable with ratio and 1.5
 
 comment results of methods can be redirected with the to preposition
 print variable to standard output
 
 comment generic calls can be done with the call verb
 call log on console with variable and ratio
 
 
 if variable is greater than 2 then
 
  if variable is greater than 2.5 then
    call log on console with this is an example
  else if variable is lower than 2.5 then
    call alert on console with this is another example
  else
    call log on console with foo bar
  end
 
 end
 
 
 let examples be a Number Array
 set examples to 1, 3, 7 and 9
 
 set index 0 on examples to 4
 push 3 to examples
 
 
 comment whatever is the string representation of examples
 let whatever be a String
 join examples to whatever
 
 comment copy is the string copy of examples
 let copy be a String Array
 split whatever to copy
 
 
 for each examples as key and value do
 
  let temp be value
  add 5 to value
  divide value by 1.76
 
  if temp is greater than 5 then
    break
  else
    call log on console with temp
  end
