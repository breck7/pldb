 example
  /* The following function will print a non-negative number, n, to
     the base b, where 2<=b<=10.  This routine uses the fact that
     in the ASCII character set, the digits 0 to 9 have sequential
     code values.  */

 summary B is a programming language developed at Bell Labs circa 1969. It is the work of Ken Thompson with Dennis Ritchie. B was derived from BCPL, and its name may be a contraction of BCPL. Thompson's coworker Dennis Ritchie speculated that the name might be based on Bon, an earlier, but unrelated, programming language that Thompson designed for use on Multics. B was designed for recursive, non-numeric, machine independent applications, such as system and language software.
