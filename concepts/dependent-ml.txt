Dependent ML is an experimental functional programming language proposed by Hongwei Xi (Xi 2007) and Frank Pfenning. Dependent ML extends ML by a restricted notion of dependent types: types may be dependent on static indices of type Nat (natural numbers). Dependent ML employs a constraint theorem prover to decide a strong equational theory over the index expressions. Read more on Wikipedia...
