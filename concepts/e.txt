E is an object-oriented programming language for secure distributed computing, created by Mark S. Miller, Dan Bornstein, and others at Electric Communities in 1997.  E is mainly descended from the concurrent language Joule and from Original-E, a set of extensions to Java for secure distributed programming. Read more on Wikipedia...
