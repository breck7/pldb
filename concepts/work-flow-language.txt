Work Flow Language, or WFL ("wiffle") is the process control language for the Burroughs large systems, including the Unisys ClearPath/MCP series, and their operating system Master Control Program. Developed soon after the B5000 in 1961, WFL is the ClearPath equivalent of the Job Control Language (JCL) on IBM mainframes and the shell scripts of Unix-like operating systems. Unlike JCL, WFL is a high-level structured language complete with subroutines (procedures and functions) with arguments and high-level program control flow instructions. Read more on Wikipedia...
