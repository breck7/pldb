The Ren'Py Visual Novel Engine is a free software engine which facilitates the creation of visual novels, a form of computer-mediated storytelling. Ren'Py is a portmanteau of ren'ai (恋愛), the Japanese word for 'romantic love', a common element of games made using Ren'Py; and Python, the programming language that Ren'Py runs on. Ren'Py has proved attractive to English-language hobbyists; over 1000 games use the Ren'Py engine, nearly all in English.. Read more on Wikipedia...

###     Demo Script Example     ###

﻿# This script, but not the artwork associated with it, is in the
# public domain. Feel free to use it as the basis for your own
# game.

# If you&#39;re trying to understand this script, I recommend skipping
# down to the line beginning with &#39;label start:&#39;, at least on your
# first read-through.

# This init block runs first, and sets up all sorts of things that
# are used by the rest of the game. Variables that are set in init
# blocks are _not_ saved, unless they are changed later on in the
# program.

init:

    # Set up the size of the screen, and the window title.
    $ config.screen_width = 800
    $ config.screen_height = 600
    $ config.window_title = &quot;The Ren&#39;Py Demo Game&quot;

    # Declare the images that are used in the program.

    # Backgrounds.
    image bg carillon = &quot;carillon.jpg&quot;
    image bg whitehouse = &quot;whitehouse.jpg&quot;
    image bg washington = &quot;washington.jpg&quot;
    image bg onememorial = &quot;1memorial.jpg&quot;
    image black = Solid((0, 0, 0, 255))

    # Character pictures.
    image eileen happy = &quot;9a_happy.png&quot;
    image eileen vhappy = &quot;9a_vhappy.png&quot;
    image eileen concerned = &quot;9a_concerned.png&quot;

    # A character object. This object lets us have the character say
    # dialogue without us having to repeatedly type her name. It also
    # lets us change the color of her name.

    $ e = Character(&#39;Eileen&#39;, color=(200, 255, 200, 255))

# The start label marks the place where the main menu jumps to to
# begin the actual game.

label start:

    # The save_name variable sets the name of the save game. Like all
    # variables declared outside of init blocks, this variable is
    # saved and restored with a save file.
    $ save_name = &quot;Introduction&quot;

    # This variable is only used by our game. If it&#39;s true, it means
    # that we won the date.
    $ date = False

    # Clear the game runtime timer, so it doesn&#39;t reflect time spent
    # sitting at the main menu.
    $ renpy.clear_game_runtime()

    # Start some m
