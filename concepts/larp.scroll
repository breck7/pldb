description LARP is an educational software for teaching algorithmic in structured programming using pseudo code and flowcharts. LARP's main advantage over traditional programming languages is its flexible and semi natural syntax, allowing one to formulate algorithms without the impediments of cryptic languages such as C++, Pascal or Java.
