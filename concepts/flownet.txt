Ethernet alternative. Like ATM, FlowNet is a switched network based on fixed-size cells. Unlike ATM, FlowNet cells are large--800 bytes instead of 53. This allows room for a 14-byte Ethernet header plus an additional QoS extension. The QoS extension header is 18 bytes, making the full FlowNet header 32 bytes long. The remaining 768 bytes (=256+512) are data payload. FlowNet interoperates with Ethernet through a simple bridge device.
