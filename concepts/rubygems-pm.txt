It was created by Chad Fowler and Richard Kilmer during RubyConf 2004.The interface for RubyGems is a command-line tool called gem which can install and manage libraries (the gems). RubyGems integrates with Ruby run-time loader to help find and load installed gems from standardized library folders. Read more on Wikipedia...
