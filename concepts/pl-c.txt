PL/C is a computer programming language developed at Cornell University with the specific goal of being used for teaching programming.  It is based on  IBM's PL/I language, and was designed in the early 1970s.  Cornell also developed a compiler for the language that was based on its earlier CUPL compiler, and it was widely used in college-level programming courses. Read more on Wikipedia...
