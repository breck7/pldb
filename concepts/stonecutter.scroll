description In this work we introduce the StoneCutter instruction set design language and tool infrastructure. StoneCutter provides a familiar, C-like language construct by which to develop the implementation for individual, programmable instructions. The LLVM-based StoneCutter compiler performs individual instruction and whole-ISA optimizations in order to generate a high performance, Chisel HDL representation of the target design. Utilizing the existing Chisel tools, users can also generate C++ cycle accurate simulation models as well as Verilog representations of the target design. As a result, StoneCutter provides a very rapid design environment for development and experimentation.
