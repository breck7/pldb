# This is a GPU kernel in Triton.
# Different instances of this
# function may run in parallel.
@jit
def add(X, Y, Z, N):
   # In Triton, each kernel instance
   # executes block operations on a
   # single thread: there is no construct
   # analogous to threadIdx
   pid = program_id(0)
   # block of indices
   idx = pid * BLOCK + arange(BLOCK)
   mask = idx &lt; N
   # Triton uses pointer arithmetics
   # rather than indexing operators
   x = load(X + idx, mask=mask)
   y = load(Y + idx, mask=mask)
   store(Z + idx, x + y, mask=mask)
