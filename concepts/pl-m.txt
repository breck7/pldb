The PL/M programming language  (an acronym of Programming Language for Microcomputers) is a high-level language conceived and developed by  Gary Kildall in 1973  for Hank Smith at Intel for its microprocessors. The language incorporated ideas from PL/I, ALGOL and XPL, and had an integrated macro processor. Unlike other contemporary languages such as Pascal, C or BASIC, PL/M had no standard input or output routines. Read more on Wikipedia...
