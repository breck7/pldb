QB64 (originally QB32) is a self-hosting BASIC compiler for Microsoft Windows, Linux and Mac OS X, designed to be compatible with Microsoft QBasic and QuickBASIC. QB64 is a C++ emitter, which is integrated with a C++ compiler to provide compilation via C++ code and GCC optimization.QB64 implements most QBasic statements, and can run many QBasic programs, including Microsoft's QBasic Gorillas and Nibbles games. Furthermore, QB64 has been designed to contain an IDE resembling the QBASIC IDE. Read more on Wikipedia...

t1 = _FREETIMER
t2 = _FREETIMER
ON TIMER(t1, 1) GOSUB Timer.Trap &#39;the code following the Timer.Trap label will be run every 1 second

ON TIMER(t2, .5) mySub &#39;QB64 can also trigger a SUB procedure with TIMER;
&#39;                       in this case mySUB will be triggered every 500 milliseconds

&#39;activate timers:
TIMER(t1) ON
TIMER(t2) ON

DO &#39;go into an infinite loop until the window is closed
    _LIMIT 1 &#39;run the main loop at 1 cycle per second, to show how timers are independent from main program flow
LOOP

Timer.Trap:
PRINT &quot;1s; &quot;;
RETURN

SUB mySub
    PRINT &quot;500ms; &quot;;
END SUB
