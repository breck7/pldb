Euler is a programming language created by Niklaus Wirth and Helmut Weber, conceived as an extension and generalization of ALGOL 60. The designers' goal was to create a language:  which was simpler, and yet more flexible, than ALGOL 60 that was a useful programming language processed with reasonable efficiency that can be defined with rigorous formalityAvailable sources indicate that Euler was operational by 1965..
