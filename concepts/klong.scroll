description A Simple Array Language. Klong is an array language, like K, but without the ambiguity. If you know K or APL, you may be disappointed by Klong. If you don't know any array languages, it might explode your brain. Use at your own risk! Note that Klong is a mathematical notation rather than a programming language. If you try to use it like your favorite functional/procedural/OO programming language, you will only get frustrated.
