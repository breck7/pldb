[lyrics
. I didn&#39;t know if I wanted to laugh or cry
. The night that disco died
. The laser lights were kicking off my dancing shoes
. But there was nobody dancing inside
. Got high with the song of doom
. The moon was listening in
.
. What will we be singing in the &#39;80s?
. What should we be singing now?
. What will we be singing in the &#39;80s?
. What should we be singing now?
