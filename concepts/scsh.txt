Scsh (a Scheme shell) is computer software, a type of shell for an operating system. It is a Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) application programming interface (API) layered on the programming language Scheme, in a manner to make the most of Scheme's ability for scripting. Scsh is limited to 32-bit platforms but there is a development version against the latest Scheme 48 that works in 64-bit mode. Read more on Wikipedia...
