 summary LSE (French: Langage symbolique d'enseignement) is a programming language developed at Supélec in the late 1970s/early 1980s. It is similar to BASIC, except with French-language instead of English-language keywords. It was derived from an earlier language called LSD, also developed at Supélec. It is most commonly said to be an acronym for Langage Symbolique d'Enseignement (Symbolic Teaching Language), but other expansions are also known (e.g. Langage de Sup-Élec, or the more cynical Langage Sans Espoir (hopeless language)). It originally flourished due to support from the French Ministry of National Education, but declined as the ministry lost interest. It went through a number of revisions; earlier versions of LSE lacked full support for structured programming, which later version added, along with exception handling.
