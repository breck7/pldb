description The YaST-language YCP is a scripting language to be interpreted by the YCP-engine (YCP interpreter) specially designed for manipulation with a system configuration. Its syntax is very similar to C programming language. Because YCP can make use of the whole infrastructure that YaST provides, the actions that can be accomplished with YCP are very powerful.
