An ISA for timeless programs. It aims to be simple, concise and powerful. It is easy to read and write by humans. In addition to supporting computations, it also natively supports multiple CPUs, disks, clocks, screens, audio, keyboards and virtual devices. It is a compilation target for the progsbase programming language.
