The ext2 or second extended file system is a file system for the Linux kernel.  It was initially designed by RÃ©my Card as a replacement for the extended file system (ext).  Having been designed according to the same principles as the Berkeley Fast File System from BSD, it was the first commercial-grade filesystem for Linux.The canonical implementation of ext2 is the "ext2fs" filesystem driver in the Linux kernel.
