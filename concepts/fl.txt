FL (short for Function Level) is a functional programming language created at the IBM Almaden Research Center by John Backus, John Williams, and Edward Wimmers in the 1980s and documented in a report from 1989. FL was designed as a successor of Backus' earlier FP language, providing specific support for what Backus termed function-level programming. FL is a dynamically typed strict functional programming language with throw and catch exception semantics much like in ML. Read more on Wikipedia...
