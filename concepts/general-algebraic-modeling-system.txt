The General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) is a high-level modeling system for mathematical optimization. GAMS is designed for modeling and solving linear, nonlinear, and mixed-integer optimization problems. The system is tailored for complex, large-scale modeling applications and allows the user to build large maintainable models that can be adapted to new situations. Read more on Wikipedia...

$Title  A Transportation Problem (TRNSPORT,SEQ=1)
$Ontext

This problem finds a least cost shipping schedule that meets
requirements at markets and supplies at factories.

Dantzig, G B, Chapter 3.3. In Linear Programming and Extensions.
Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey, 1963.

This formulation is described in detail in:
Rosenthal, R E, Chapter 2: A GAMS Tutorial. In GAMS: A User&#39;s Guide.
The Scientific Press, Redwood City, California, 1988.

The line numbers will not match those in the book because of these
