Free Pascal Compiler (FPC) is a compiler for the closely related programming language dialects, Pascal and Object Pascal. It is free software released under the GNU General Public License, with exception clauses that allow for static linking against its runtime libraries and packages for any purpose in combination with any other software license. It supports its own Object Pascal dialect as well as the dialects of several other Pascal family compilers to a certain extent, including those of Turbo Pascal, Delphi, and some historical Macintosh compilers.
