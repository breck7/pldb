 summary Blockly is a client-side JavaScript library for creating visual block programming languages and editors. It is a project of Google and is open-source under the Apache 2.0 License. It typically runs in a web browser, and visually resembles Scratch. Blockly is also being implemented for Android and iOS; not all web browser based features are available for Android/iOS. Blockly uses visual blocks that link together to make writing code easier, and can generate JavaScript, Python, PHP or Dart code. It can also be customised to generate code in any textual computer language.
