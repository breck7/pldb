 summary Conway chained arrow notation, created by mathematician John Horton Conway, is a means of expressing certain extremely large numbers. It is simply a finite sequence of positive integers separated by rightward arrows, e.g.                         2         →         3         →         4         →         5         →         6                 {\displaystyle 2\to 3\to 4\to 5\to 6}   . As with most combinatorial notations, the definition is recursive. In this case the notation eventually resolves to being the leftmost number raised to some (usually enormous) integer power.
