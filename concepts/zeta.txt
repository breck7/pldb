A prototype implementation of xoc in zeta, a C-like interpreted procedural language with first-class functions. Zeta makes writing extensions easier than standard C, although extension writers must adjust to a slightly different language. Our implementation runs zeta using a bytecode interpreter and is therefore limited in its performance; we plan to replace the bytecode interpreter with compilation to machine code, which should reduce the compilation time for a large program from tens of seconds to a fraction of a second.
