description Curry is a declarative multi-paradigm programming language which combines in a seamless way features from functional programming (nested expressions, higher-order functions, strong typing, lazy evaluation) and logic programming (non-determinism, built-in search, free variables, partial data structures). Compared to the single programming paradigms, Curry provides additional features, like optimal evaluation for logic-oriented computations and flexible, non-deterministic pattern matching with user-defined functions.

 summary Curry is an experimental functional logic programming language, based on the Haskell language. It merges elements of functional and logic programming, including constraint programming integration. It is nearly a superset of Haskell, lacking support mostly for overloading using type classes, which some implementations provide anyway as a language extension, such as the MÃ¼nster Curry Compiler.
