Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE), formerly Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE), currently Jakarta EE, is a set of specifications, extending Java SE 8 (i.e. not based on latest Java 11; while can also work with later it or later than Java 8) with specifications for enterprise features such as distributed computing and web services. Java EE applications are run on reference runtimes, that can be microservices or application servers, which handle transactions, security, scalability, concurrency and management of the components it is deploying.
