Balanced ternary is a non-standard positional numeral system (a balanced form), used in some early computers and useful in the solution of balance puzzles. It is a ternary (base 3) number system in which the digits have the values â€“1, 0, and 1, in contrast to the standard (unbalanced) ternary system, in which digits have values 0, 1 and 2.  Balanced ternary can represent all integers without using a separate minus sign; the value of the leading non-zero digit of a number has the sign of the number itself. Read more on Wikipedia...
