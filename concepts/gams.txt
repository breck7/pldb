Scalar f  freight in dollars per case per thousand miles  /90/ ;
Parameter
       c(i,j)  transport cost in thousands of dollars per case ;
c(i,j) = f * d(i,j) / 1000 ;
Variables
     x(i,j)  shipment quantities in cases
     z       total transportation costs in thousands of dollars ;
Positive variables x ;
Equations
     cost        define objective function
     supply(i)   observe supply limit at plant i
     demand(j)   satisfy demand at market j ;
cost ..        z  =e=  sum((i,j), c(i,j)*x(i,j)) ;
supply(i) ..   sum(j, x(i,j))  =l=  a(i) ;
demand(j) ..   sum(i, x(i,j))  =g=  b(j) ;
Model transport /all/ ;
Solve transport using LP minimizing z ;
