example
 Midnight takes your heart and your soul
 While your heart is as high as your soul
 Put your heart without your soul into your heart
 
 Give back your heart
 
 
 Desire is a lovestruck ladykiller
 My world is nothing
 Fire is ice
 Hate is water
 Until my world is Desire,
 Build my world up
 If Midnight taking my world, Fire is nothing and Midnight taking my world, Hate is nothing
 Shout "FizzBuzz!"
 Take it to the top
 
 If Midnight taking my world, Fire is nothing
 Shout "Fizz!"
 Take it to the top
 
 If Midnight taking my world, Hate is nothing
 Say "Buzz!"
 Take it to the top
 
 Whisper my world
