Addressing this need, we present EverParse3D, a parser generator for binary message formats that yields performant C code backed by fully automated formal proofs of memory safety, arithmetic safety, functional correctness, and even double-fetch freedom to prevent certain kinds of time-of check/time-of-use errors. This allows systems developers to specify their message formats declaratively and to integrate correct-by-construction C code into their applications, eliminating several classes of bugs. EverParse3D has been in use in the Windows kernel for the past year. Applied primarily to the Hyper-V network virtualization stack, the formats of nearly 100 different messages spanning four protocols have been specified in EverParse3D and the resulting formally proven parsers have replaced prior handwritten code.

- EverParse3D first developed in Microsoft
- EverParse3D compiles to C
