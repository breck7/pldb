This space-sensitive database format is designed to store a dictionary of elements, accessible by name. The parser is a mere 50 lines, and allows for human-readable data structures for static sites such as Oscean, also see Tablatal. In the Indental file, an unindented line declares the key to a new root node, children lines can associate either parameters or lists to their parent node, a line divided with a colon will associate a value to a parameter to the parent node, and a sequence of equally indented lines will append to a list.
