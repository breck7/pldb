Handel-C is a high-level programming language which targets low-level hardware, most commonly used in the programming of FPGAs. It is a rich subset of C, with non-standard extensions to control hardware instantiation with an emphasis on parallelism.  Handel-C is to hardware design what the first high-level programming languages were to programming CPUs. Read more on Wikipedia...
