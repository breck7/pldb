  ; We know enough now to start writing macros.  Macros are basically
  ; functions that generate code.  Of course, generating code is easy;
  ; just call list.
  ;
  ; arc> (list '+ 1 2)
  ; (+ 1 2)
  ;
  ; What macros offer is a way of getting code generated this way into
  ; your programs.  Here's a (rather stupid) macro definition:
  ;
  ; arc> (mac foo ()
  ;        (list '+ 1 2))
  ; *** redefining foo
  ; #3(tagged mac #)
  ;
  ; Notice that a macro definition looks exactly like a function
  ; definition, but with def replaced by mac.
  ;
  ; What this macro says is that whenever the expression (foo) occurs
  ; in your code, it shouldn't be evaluated in the normal way like a
  ; function call.  Instead it should be replaced by the result of
  ; evaluating the body of the macro definition, (list '+ 1 2).
  ; This is called the "expansion" of the macro call.
