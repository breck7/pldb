  # a preceding backslash to ensure that they are properly loaded.
  # However, there is no need to precede the value characters =, and : by a backslash.

 summary .properties is a file extension for files mainly used in Java related technologies to store the configurable parameters of an application. They can also be used for storing strings for Internationalization and localization; these are known as Property Resource Bundles. Each parameter is stored as a pair of strings, one storing the name of the parameter (called the key), and the other storing the value.
