Quake is a simple, specialized language and its interpreter drawing on elements of the C language, the Bourne shell, and the C pre-processor. The cm3 compiler includes a quake interpreter as its extension language. In fact, the configuration file, cm3.cfg, and m3makefiles are quake scripts. Quake was designed to be a simple extension language for the builder. Building a complete, general-purpose language was not one of the goals. Cm3 calls out to quake every time it needs to do something that needs to be specialized such as compiling C files or linking.
