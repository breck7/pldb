 summary wxBasic is a free software / open-source software, cross-platform BASIC interpreter. As it is based on syntax of the BASIC language, it is designed to be simple to learn and understand, and allow novice programmers to write applications for graphical environments like Windows and Linux with minimal effort.  wxBasic is a bytecode based language, like Perl or Java. It is licensed under the LGPL, so proprietary software's source code can be linked against it. It can create stand-alone executables by binding together source code with the interpreter. In contrast with executables created by similar commercial programs like Visual Basic, executables produced by wxBasic do not require any external DLL file, resource file, or installer to run.  The executable is distributed alone and can be run immediately by end-users.  As with programs written in any interpreted language, wxBasic programs may also be run straight from the source code on any platform, if wxBasic is present.    wxBasic is written primarily in C, with some C++ linking it to the wxWidgets library. wxWidgets supplies the cross-platform features. It runs on Microsoft Windows using native controls, and on Linux and macOS using the GTK+ library.
