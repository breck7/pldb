In computing, CLISP is an implementation of the programming language Common Lisp originally developed by Bruno Haible and Michael Stoll for the Atari ST. Today it supports the Unix and Microsoft Windows  operating systems. CLISP includes an interpreter, a bytecode compiler, debugger, socket interface, high-level foreign language interface, strong internationalization support, and two object systems: Common Lisp Object System (CLOS) and metaobject protocol (MOP).
