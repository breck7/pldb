 summary RPG is a high-level programming language (HLL) for business applications. RPG is an IBM proprietary programming language and its later versions are available only on IBM i- or OS/400-based systems. It has a long history, having been developed by IBM in 1959 as the Report Program Generator - a tool to replicate punched card processing on the IBM 1401 then updated to RPG II for the IBM System/3 in the late 1960s, and since evolved into an HLL equivalent to COBOL and PL/I. It remains a popular programming language on the IBM i operating system, which runs on IBM Power i platform hardware. The current version, RPG IV (a.k.a. ILE RPG), provides a modern programming environment.
