Project Jupyter ( ( listen)) is a nonprofit organization created to "develop open-source software, open-standards, and services for interactive computing across dozens of programming languages."  Spun-off from IPython in 2014 by Fernando PÃ©rez, Project Jupyter supports execution environments in several dozen languages.  Project Jupyter's name is a reference to the three core programming languages supported by Jupyter, which are Julia, Python and R, and also an homage to Galileo's notebooks recording the discovery of the moons of Jupiter. Project Jupyter has developed and supported the interactive computing products Jupyter Notebook, Jupyter Hub, and Jupyter Lab, the next-generation version of Jupyter Notebook..
