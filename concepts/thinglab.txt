ThingLab is a visual programming environment implemented in Smalltalk and designed at Xerox PARC by Alan Borning. A conventional system allows a user to provide inputs that produce outputs.  A constraint-oriented system, such as ThingLab, allows the user to provide arbitrary inputs or outputs, then solves for whatever is unknown. Read more on Wikipedia...
