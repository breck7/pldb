Le Lisp (also Le_Lisp and Le-Lisp) is a programming language, a dialect of the language Lisp.It was developed at the French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation (INRIA), to be an implementation language for a very large scale integration (VLSI) workstation being designed under the direction of Jean Vuillemin. Le Lisp also had to run on various incompatible platforms (mostly running Unix operating systems) that were used by the project. The main goals for the language were to be a powerful post-Maclisp version of Lisp that would be portable, compatible, extensible, and efficient.Jérôme Chailloux led the Le Lisp team, working with Emmanuel St. Read more on Wikipedia...
