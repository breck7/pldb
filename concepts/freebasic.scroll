 summary FreeBASIC  is a multiplatform, free/open source (GPL) BASIC compiler for Microsoft Windows, protected-mode MS-DOS (DOS extender), Linux, FreeBSD and Xbox.  The Xbox version is no longer maintained.According to its official Web site, FreeBASIC provides syntax compatibility with programs originally written in Microsoft QuickBASIC (QB).  Unlike QuickBASIC, however, FreeBASIC is a command line only compiler, unless users manually install an external integrated development environment (IDE) of their choice.   IDEs specifically made for FreeBASIC include FBide and FbEdit.
