 summary Structured text, abbreviated as ST or STX, is one of the five languages supported by the IEC 61131-3 standard, designed for programmable logic controllers (PLCs). It is a high level language that is block structured and syntactically resembles Pascal, on which it is based. All of the languages share IEC61131 Common Elements. The variables and function calls are defined by the common elements so different languages within the IEC 61131-3 standard can be used in the same program. Complex statements and nested instructions are supported:  Iteration loops (REPEAT-UNTIL; WHILE-DO) Conditional execution (IF-THEN-ELSE; CASE) Functions (SQRT(), SIN())
