Hope is a small functional programming language developed in the 1970s at Edinburgh University. It predates Miranda and Haskell and is contemporaneous with ML (also developed at Edinburgh). Hope was derived from NPL, a simple functional language developed by Rod Burstall and John Darlington in their work on program transformation. Read more on Wikipedia...

  Hope enables us to use a function with two arguments as an infix operator. e must assign it a priority and use it as an infix operator everywhere, including the equations that define it. A bigger number in the infix declaration means a higher priority. Most of Hope's standard functions are supplied as infix operators.
