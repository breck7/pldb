Omega is a general purpose problem solving language with an informal conversational interface. Like pure functional programming languages, It is declarative and side-effect free. It is a pure calculus of types where each type characterizes a category of things. Omega expands the range of applications of automated systems by validly characterizing and answering questions about anything that can be imagined including infinite, incompletely knowable and nonexistent things.
