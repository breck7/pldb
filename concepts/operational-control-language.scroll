  ** Procedure PROC1
  **
  ** Written by Joe User 2006-05-29
  **
  **
  // * 'PROC1 procedure is running'
  // * ' '
  // IFF ACTIVE-'PROC2,PROC3' GOTO OKAY
  ** IFF means 'if false'
  ** ACTIVE-'nnn,nnn2' means at least one of the listed programs is currently running
  ** GOTO xxx means skip to the statement that says TAG xxx and resume processing
  // PAUSE ' Cannot continue because other Payroll is running'
  // CANCEL                                               stops execution of this procedure
  // TAG OKAY
  // IFF DATAF1-PFILE1 IFF DATAF1-PFILE2 GOTO NODELT
  // * ' Caution, Pay Data Exists'                        displays info on CRT
  // * ' '
  // * ' Press 1 to continue and DELETE existing files'
  // IFF '1'=?1R? CANCEL     A parameter is indicated by question marks surrounding a number
  ** Using 1R between question marks indicates that the parameter is required and processing
  ** waits for user input.  CANCEL means immediately go to end of job.
  // LOAD $DELET                                         $DELET is used to delete files
  // RUN
  // IF DATAF1-PFILE1 SCRATCH UNIT-F1,LABEL-PFILE1       deletes a disk file
  // IF DATAF1-PFILE2 SCRATCH UNIT-F1,LABEL-PFILE2
  // END                                              END returns control from a system program
  // LOAD PR101                                          PR101 is the sample RPG program
  // FILE NAME-PAYMAST,DISP-SHR                          PAYMAST is the payroll master file
  // FILE NAME-PFILE1,DISP-NEW,RECORDS-100,EXTEND-100    A new file PFILE1 is created
  ** 100 records are assigned to PFILE1 - if full, the system tries to extend it by another 100
  ** each time it fills.
  // RUN
  ** It's not necessary or valid to put an END statement after most user programs
  // SWITCH 1XXXXXXX                                    Causes U1 to be SETON in the RPG program
  // LOCAL OFFSET-1,DATA-'PROC1'      Places PROC1 in the Local Data Area
  // LOCAL OFFSET-101,DATA-'?USER?'   Substitutes the operator's User ID
  ** LDA becomes the external data structure (UDS) in an RPG program
  // LOAD PR102
  // FILE NAME-PAYMAST,DISP-SHR                         DISP-SHR means the file is shared
  ** Other programs can use PAYMAST at the same time
  // FILE NAME-PFILE,LABEL-PFILE1
  ** NAME/LABEL is used when the RPG disk file and the actual disk file names are different.
  // RUN
  // RETURN                                             Return means go to end-of-job
