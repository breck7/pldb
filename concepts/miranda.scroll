 example
  > || The infinite list of all prime numbers.
  
  The list of potential prime numbers starts as all integers from 2 onwards;
  as each prime is returned, all the following numbers that can exactly be
  divided by it are filtered out of the list of candidates.
  
  > primes = sieve [2..]
  > sieve (p:x) = p : sieve [n | n <- x; n mod p ~= 0]

 summary Miranda is a lazy, purely functional programming language designed by David Turner as a successor to his earlier programming languages SASL and KRC, using some concepts from ML and Hope.  It was produced by Research Software Ltd. of England (which holds a trademark on the name Miranda) and was the first purely functional language to be commercially supported.Miranda was first released in 1985, as a fast interpreter in C for Unix-flavour operating systems, with subsequent releases in 1987 and 1989. Miranda had a strong influence on the later Haskell programming language.
