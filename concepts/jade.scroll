 summary JADE is a proprietary object-oriented software development and deployment platform product from the New Zealand-based Jade Software Corporation, first released in 1996. It consists of the JADE programming language, IDE and debugger, integrated application server and object database management system. Designed as an end-to-end development environment to allow systems to be coded in one language from the database server down to the clients, it also provides APIs for other languages, including .NET Framework, Java, C/C++ and Web services. Although a free limited licence is available for development, using the JADE platform requires per-process fees to be paid.
