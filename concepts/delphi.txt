Embarcadero Delphi is an integrated development environment (IDE) for desktop, mobile, web, and console applications. It's also an event driven language. Delphi's compilers use their own Object Pascal dialect of Pascal and generate native code for several platforms: Windows (x86 and x64), OS X (32-bit only), iOS (32 and 64-bit), Android and Linux (64-bit Intel).
