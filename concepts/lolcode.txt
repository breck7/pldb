LOLCODE is an esoteric programming language inspired by lolspeak, the language expressed in examples of the lolcat Internet meme. The language was created in 2007 by Adam Lindsay, researcher at the Computing Department of Lancaster University. The language is not clearly defined in terms of operator priorities and correct syntax, but several functioning interpreters and compilers exist. Read more on Wikipedia...

    TLDR

    OBTW prev is the number used in the randin function.
         I had to declare it in global scope so that it
         would retain its value between calls to randin.
    TLDR
    I HAS A prev ITZ 0
    I HAS A rand_max ITZ 104729

    OBTW Equivalent to C&#39;s rand() function, except returns
        a number in the range of 0 to rand_max.
    TLDR
    HOW IZ I randin
        I HAS A a ITZ 33083
        I HAS A c ITZ 67607
        prev R MOD OF SUM OF PRODUKT OF prev AN a AN c AN rand_max
        FOUND YR prev
    IF U SAY SO

    BTW Returns a random number within the range of 0-1.
    HOW IZ I rand_onein
        I HAS A rand_num ITZ I IZ randin MKAY
        rand_num IS NOW A NUMBAR
        I HAS A rand_max_float ITZ MAEK rand_max A NUMBAR
        FOUND YR  QUOSHUNT OF rand_num AN rand_max_float
    IF U SAY SO

    OBTW Equivalent to C ceil() function. Returns the next
        largest integer for the given number.
    TLDR
    HOW IZ I ceilin YR num
        I HAS A int_num ITZ num
        int_num IS NOW A NUMBR
        BOTH SAEM int_num AN num, O RLY?
            YA RLY, FOUND YR num
        OIC
        DIFFRINT num AN SMALLR OF num AN 0, O RLY?
            YA RLY
                int_num R SUM OF int_num AN 1
                FOUND YR MAEK int_num A NUMBAR
        OIC
        DIFFRINT num AN BIGGR OF num AN 0, O RLY?
            YA RLY
                FOUND YR MAEK int_num A NUMBAR
        OIC
    IF U SAY SO

    OBTW Convert a number to hexadecimal. This
         is returned as a string.
    TLDR
    HOW IZ I decimal_to_hex YR num
        I HAS A i ITZ 0
        I HAS A rem
        I HAS A hex_num ITZ A BUKKIT
        I HAS A decimal_num ITZ num
        IM IN YR num_loop
            rem R MOD OF decimal_num AN 16
            I HAS A hex_digit
            rem, WTF?
                OMG 10, hex_digit R &quot;A&quot;, GTFO
                OMG 1

HAI 1.2
  VISIBLE &quot;Hello, world!&quot;
KTHXBYE

HAI
CAN HAS STDIO?
VISIBLE &quot;Hello World&quot;
KTHXBYE

HAI 1.2
CAN HAS STDIO?
IM IN YR LOOP UPPIN YR VAR TIL BOTH SAEM VAR AN 10
    VISIBLE SUM OF VAR AN 1
IM OUTTA YR LOOP
KTHXBYE
