    hello_world = do
        `console.log(&quot;Hello World&quot;)` -- Calls to Javascript always return type `JS a`
        x &lt;- `Math.sqrt(9)`          -- `x` is inferred to be the unrestricted type `a`
        let z = x + 1                -- `x` is now restricted to type `Num`
        return (z + 1)                  -- type of `hello_world` is inferred to be `JS Num`
    8 == do! hello_world &gt;&gt;= λx = `x + 3`
