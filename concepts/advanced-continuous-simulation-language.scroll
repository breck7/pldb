 summary The Advanced Continuous Simulation Language, or ACSL (pronounced "axle"), is a computer language designed for modeling and evaluating the performance of continuous systems described by time-dependent, nonlinear differential equations. Like SIMCOS and TUTSIM, ACSL is a dialect of the Continuous System Simulation Language (CSSL), originally designed by the Simulation Councils Inc (SCI) in 1967 in an attempt to unify the continuous simulations field.
