ALGOL 60 (short for Algorithmic Language 1960) is a member of the ALGOL family of computer programming languages. It followed on from ALGOL 58 which had introduced code blocks and the begin and end pairs for delimiting them.  ALGOL 60 was the first language implementing nested function definitions with lexical scope. Read more on Wikipedia...
