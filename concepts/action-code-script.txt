Action Code Script (ACS) is a scripting language used in video games such as HeXen and some modern Doom source ports, such as ZDoom. It is syntactically similar to C, but less flexible. As its name implies, most of the core logic for script functionality comes in the form of "scripts", which are traditionally identified with a numerical value. Read more on Wikipedia...
