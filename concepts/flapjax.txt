Flapjax is a programming language built on JavaScript. It provides a spreadsheet-like reactive programming, dataflow computing style, termed functional reactive programming, making it easy to create reactive web pages without the burden of callbacks and potentially inconsistent mutation. Flapjax can be viewed in two ways: either as a library, for use in regular JavaScript programs, or as a new language that the compiler converts into generic JavaScript. Read more on Wikipedia...
