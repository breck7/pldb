Nu is an interpreted object-oriented programming language, with a Lisp-like syntax, created by Tim Burks as an alternative scripting language to program OS X through its Cocoa application programming interface (API). Implementations also exist for iPhone and Linux. The language was first announced at C4, a conference for indie Mac developers held in August 2007.. Read more on Wikipedia...
