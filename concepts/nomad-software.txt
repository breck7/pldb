Nomad Software is a relational database and fourth-generation language (4GL), originally developed in the 1970s by time-sharing vendor National CSS. While it is still in use today, its widest use was in the 1970s and 1980s. Nomad provides both interactive and batch environments for data management and application development, including commands for database definition, data manipulation, and reporting.
