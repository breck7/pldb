LSE (French: Langage symbolique d'enseignement) is a programming language developed at Supélec in the late 1970s/early 1980s. It is similar to BASIC, except with French-language instead of English-language keywords. It was derived from an earlier language called LSD, also developed at Supélec. Read more on Wikipedia...
