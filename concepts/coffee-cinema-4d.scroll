 summary COFFEE (often written as "C.O.F.F.E.E") is a computer scripting language that forms part of CINEMA 4D, a proprietary 3D graphics application. Although presented as an acronym the letters of the word COFFEE do not appear to stand for anything, but are rather a comic reference to Java, a considerably more famous computer language.
