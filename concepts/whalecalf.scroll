description Whale Calf is a research-level parser generator for Boolean grammars, which are context-free grammars augmented with Boolean operations. It is written by Alexander Okhotin in C++, and is mainly aimed at demonstrating different parsing algorithms, of which the most practically useful is the Generalized LR (GLR). The main development took place in 2000-2004, though (as of April 2017) some occasional corrections are still being made.
