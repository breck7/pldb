Split-C is a parallel extension of the C programming language. The Split-C project website describes Split-C as:  a parallel extension of the C programming language that supports efficient access to a global address space on current distributed memory multiprocessors. It retains the "small language" character of C and supports careful engineering and optimization of programs by providing a simple, predictable cost model. Read more on Wikipedia...
