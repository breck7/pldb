Atomese was originally intended to be a language for knowledge representation (KR): that is, a way of encoding facts and hypothesis, in a machine-readable way, such that the knowledge can be manipulated, data-mined, reasoned with. This language subset was vaguely inspired by Prolog and Datalog. More correctly, it was constructed by layering concepts from mathematical logic onto a graph database: representing logical, symbolic statements as graphs.
