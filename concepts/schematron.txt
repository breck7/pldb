Schematron is a rule-based validation language for making assertions about the presence or absence of patterns in XML trees.  It is a structural schema language expressed in XML using a small number of elements and XPath. In a typical implementation, the Schematron schema XML is processed into normal XSLT code for deployment anywhere that XSLT can be used. Read more on Wikipedia...
