 summary Rocky Mountain BASIC (also RMB or RM-BASIC) is a dialect of the BASIC programming language created by Hewlett-Packard.  It was especially popular for control of automatic test equipment using GPIB.  It has several features which are or were unusual in BASIC dialects, such as event-driven operation, extensive external I/O support, complex number support, and matrix manipulation functions.  Today, RMB is mainly used in environments where an investment in RMB software, hardware, or expertise already exists.
