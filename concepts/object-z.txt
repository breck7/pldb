Object-Z is an object-oriented extension to the Z notation developed at the University of Queensland, Australia. Object-Z extends Z by the addition of language constructs resembling the object-oriented paradigm, most notably, classes. Other object-oriented notions such as polymorphism and inheritance are also supported. Read more on Wikipedia...
