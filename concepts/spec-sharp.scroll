 summary Spec# is a programming language with specification language features that extends the capabilities of the C# programming language with Eiffel-like contracts, including object invariants, preconditions and postconditions. Like ESC/Java, it includes a static checking tool based on a theorem prover that is able to statically verify many of these invariants. It also includes a variety of other minor extensions to the language, such as non-null reference types. The code contracts API in the .NET Framework 4.0 has evolved with Spec#. Microsoft Research developed both Spec# and C#; in turn, Spec# serves as the foundation of the Sing# programming language, which Microsoft Research also developed.
