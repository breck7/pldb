Algebraic modeling languages (AML) are high-level computer programming languages for describing and solving high complexity problems for large scale mathematical computation (i.e. large scale optimization type problems). One particular advantage of some algebraic modeling languages like AIMMS, AMPL, GAMS,MathProg, Mosel,  and OPL is the similarity of their syntax to the mathematical notation of optimization problems.
