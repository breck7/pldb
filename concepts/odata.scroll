wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Data_Protocol
 summary In computing, Open Data Protocol (OData) is an open  protocol which allows the creation and consumption of queryable and interoperable RESTful  APIs in a simple and standard way. Microsoft initiated OData in 2007. Versions 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 are released under the Microsoft Open Specification Promise. Version 4.0 was standardized at OASIS, with a release in March 2014. In April 2015 OASIS submitted OData v4 and OData JSON Format v4 to ISO/IEC JTC 1 for approval as an international standard.The protocol enables the creation and consumption of  REST APIs, which allow  Web clients to publish and edit resources, identified using URLs and defined in a data model, using simple HTTP messages. OData shares some similarities with JDBC and with ODBC; like ODBC, OData is not limited to relational databases.
