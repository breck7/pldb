JAL (Just Another Language) is a Pascal-like programming language and compiler that generates executable code for PIC microcontrollers.  It is a free-format language with a compiler that runs on Linux, MS-Windows and MS-DOS (OSX support). It is configurable and extendable through the use of libraries and can even be combined with PIC assembly language.. Read more on Wikipedia...
