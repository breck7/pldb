 summary Programming Language for Business or PL/B is a business-oriented programming language originally called DATABUS and designed by Datapoint in 1972[2] as an alternative to COBOL because Datapoint's 8-bit computers could not fit COBOL into their limited memory, and because COBOL did not at the time have facilities to deal with Datapoint's built-in keyboard and screen.
