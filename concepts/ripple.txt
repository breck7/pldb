// Stage
//   - A target object of this simulation
stage n as long; // the number of mice
// Parameter
param c as int;  // the number of mice which one mouse gives birth to
// Initialization
init {
    n&lt;0&gt; = 2; // n&lt;0&gt; means the value of n when time is 0
}
// Operation
//   - Code which is executed every time (like recurrence formula)
operation {
    n&lt;next&gt; = n&lt;now&gt; * c; // &quot;now&quot; and &quot;next&quot; are keywords in Ripple. next == now + 1.
