description IBM internal systems programming language (Programming Language/Cross Systems). There has been a progression from the original PL/S to the current PL/X. The language looks like and was originally based on PL/1 but it has picked up modern features along the way as well as features specifically for writing system software. AFAIK code exists written in all of the PL/* dialects and that the current PL/X compiler can handle all of them. Mark knows a lot better and may feel like commenting.
