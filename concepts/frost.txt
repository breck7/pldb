========================================================
Simple version of the Unix `head` utility. Reads a file
and outputs the first `count` lines from it to the
standard output stream.

@param path the file to read
@param count the number of lines to display
========================================================
method head(path:File, count:Int) {
    try {
        path.lines()[..count].apply(Console.printLine)
    }
    fail(error) {
        abort(error.message)
    }
}

method abort(msg:String) {
    Console.printLine(msg)
    System.exit(1)
}

method main(args:ListView&lt;String&gt;) {
    if args.count != 3 {
        abort(&quot;usage: head &lt;path&gt; &lt;count&gt;&quot;)
    }
    def count := args[2].asInt
    if count == null {
        abort(&quot;error: &#39;\{args[2]}&#39; is not an integer&quot;)
    }
    head(File(args[1]), count)
}
