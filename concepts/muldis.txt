Muldis Data Language is an industrial-strength computationally complete high-level application programming language with fully integrated database functionality; you can use it to define, query, and update ("object") relational databases, as well as write general purpose applications. The language's paradigm is a mixture of declarative, homoiconic, functional, imperative, and object-oriented. Muldis Data Language is currently under development.
