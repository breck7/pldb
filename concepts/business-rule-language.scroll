aka BRL
description Business Rule Language (BRL) allows IF/THEN testing on certain information available when the rules execute. Your own cancel message can be included within the rules you create by using special message variables. BRL is a non-procedural, high-level application development language that allows you to develop sophisticated programs with less effort than conventional programming languages. BRL rules consist of three parts: the rule name, which serves as a comment or description, and is not syntactically necessary to the rule; a supporting condition (antecedent) or procedure statement; and a conclusion.
