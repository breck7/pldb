Dartmouth BASIC is the original version of the BASIC programming language.  It is so named because it was designed and implemented at Dartmouth College by John Kem√©ny and Thomas Kurtz. It was developed as part of the Dartmouth Time Sharing System (DTSS) and was one of the first programming languages intended to be used interactively. Read more on Wikipedia...
