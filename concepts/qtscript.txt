QtScript is a scripting engine that has been part of the Qt cross-platform application framework since version 4.3.0. The scripting language is based on the ECMAScript standard with a few extensions, such as QObject-style signal and slot connections. The library contains the engine, and a C++ API for evaluating QtScript code and exposing custom QObject-derived C++ classes to QtScript. Read more on Wikipedia...
