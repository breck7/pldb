description RPL (Reactive Plan Language) belongs to the family of notations for writing reactive plans for agents (e.g., robots) (Davis 1984, Ingrand and George 1990, Lyons 1990a,b, Gat 1991). Its immediate ancestor is Firby's (1987, 1989) RAP notation. Many of Firby's concepts have been carried over, but there are some differences
