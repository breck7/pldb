Coco/R is a compiler generator that takes an L-attributed Extended Backusâ€“Naur Form (EBNF) grammar of a source language and generates a scanner and a parser for that language. The scanner works as a deterministic finite automaton.  It supports Unicode characters in UTF-8 encoding and can be made case-sensitive or case-insensitive. Read more on Wikipedia...
