Augeas is a free software  configuration-management library, written in the C programming language.  It is licensed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License. Augeas uses programs called  lenses (in reference to the Harmony Project) to map a filesystem to an XML tree which can then be parsed using an XPath syntax, using a bidirectional transformation.
