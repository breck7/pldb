\section{Hello world}

Today I awoke and decided to write
some code, so I started to write Hello World in \textsf C.

&lt;&lt;hello.c&gt;&gt;=
/*
  &lt;&lt;license&gt;&gt;
*/
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  printf(&quot;Hello World!\n&quot;);
  return 0;
}
@
\noindent \ldots then I did the same in PHP.

&lt;&lt;hello.php&gt;&gt;=
&lt;?php
  /*
  &lt;&lt;license&gt;&gt;
  */
  echo &quot;Hello world!\n&quot;;
?&gt;
