 summary A CUSIP is a nine-character alphanumeric code that identifies a North American financial security for the purposes of facilitating clearing and settlement of trades.  The CUSIP was adopted as an American National Standard under Accredited Standards X9.6. The CUSIP system is owned by the American Bankers Association and is operated by S&P Global Market Intelligence. The operating body, CUSIP Global Services (CGS), also serves as the national numbering agency (NNA) for North America, and the CUSIP serves as the National Securities Identification Number (NSIN) for products issued from both the United States and Canada. In its role as the NNA, CUSIP Global Services (CGS) also assigns all US-based ISINs.
