MVFLEX Expression Language (MVEL) is a hybrid dynamic/statically typed, embeddable Expression Language and runtime for the Java Platform.  Originally started as a utility language for an application framework, the project is now developed completely independently. MVEL is typically used for exposing basic logic to end-users and programmers through configuration such as XML files or annotations. Read more on Wikipedia...
