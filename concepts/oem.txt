The Object Exchange Model  (OEM) is a model for exchanging semi-structured data between object-oriented databases. It serves as the basic data model in numerous projects of the Stanford University Database Group, including Tsimmis, Lore, and C3. Slight variations of OEM have evolved across different Stanford projects. Read more on Wikipedia...
