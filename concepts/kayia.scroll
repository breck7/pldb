description Kayia is a way to construct a “declarative reactive” language based on a labeled,  directed graph of edges.  The excitement that I have with Kayia is that I think it has the potential to give software construction “the arch”, or that missing abstraction mechanism that has been holding it back.  That’s a bold statement but I am attempting to prove that, because of its ability to start from such fine elements, simply A|B, and its capacity to manage yet not obstruct constructions of those elements, we can get higher-resolution constructions with greater control at the same time.
