Punycode is a representation of Unicode with the limited ASCII character subset used for Internet hostnames. Using Punycode, host names containing Unicode characters are transcoded to a subset of ASCII consisting of letters, digits, and hyphens, which is called the Letter-Digit-Hyphen (LDH) subset.  For example, MÃ¼nchen (German name for Munich) is encoded as Mnchen-3ya. Read more on Wikipedia...
