XBasic is a variant of the BASIC programming language that was developed in the late 1980s for the Motorola 88000 CPU and Unix by Max Reason. In the early 1990s it was ported to Windows and Linux, and since 1999 it has been available as open source software with its runtime library under the LGPL license. It should not be confused with TI Extended BASIC, which is sometimes called XBasic or X Basic. Read more on Wikipedia...
