PLEX (Programming Language for EXchanges) is a special-purpose, concurrent, real-time programming language.  The PLEX language is closely tied to the architecture of Ericsson's AXE telephone exchanges which it was designed to control. PLEX was developed by Göran Hemdahl at Ericsson in the 1970s,  and it has been continuously evolving since then. Read more on Wikipedia...
