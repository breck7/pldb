Stackless Python, or Stackless, is a Python programming language interpreter, so named because it avoids depending on the C call stack for its own stack. In practice, Stackless Python uses the C stack, but the stack is cleared between function calls . The most prominent feature of Stackless is microthreads, which avoid much of the overhead associated with usual operating system threads. Read more on Wikipedia...
