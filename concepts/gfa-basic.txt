GFA BASIC is a dialect of the BASIC programming language, by Frank Ostrowski.  The name is derived from the company ("GFA Systemtechnik GmbH"), which distributed the software. In the mid-1980s to the 1990s it enjoyed popularity as an advanced BASIC dialect, but has been mostly superseded by several other programming languages. Read more on Wikipedia...
