SQL PL stands for Structured Query Language Procedural Language and was developed by IBM as a set of commands that extend the use of SQL in the IBM DB2 (DB2 UDB Version 7) database system. It provides procedural programmability in addition to the querying commands of SQL. It is a subset of the SQL Persistent Stored Modules (SQL/PSM) language standard. Read more on Wikipedia...
