SQL-like query language interface called the Hive query language. While based on SQL, HiveQL does not strictly follow the full SQL-92 standard. Internally, a compiler translates HiveQL statements into a directed acyclic graph of MapReduce, Tez, or Spark jobs, which are submitted to Hadoop for execution.
