LIS (Language d'Implementation de Syst√®mes) was a system implementation programming language designed by Jean Ichbiah, who later designed Ada. LIS was used to implement the compiler for the Ada-0 subset of Ada at Karlsruhe on the BS2000 Siemens operating system. Later on the Karlsruhe Ada compilation system got rewritten in Ada-0 itself, which was easy, because LIS and Ada-0 are very close.. Read more on Wikipedia...
