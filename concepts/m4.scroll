 summary m4 is a general-purpose macro processor included in all UNIX-like operating systems, and is a component of the POSIX standard. The language was designed by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie for the original versions of UNIX. It is an extension of an earlier macro processor m3, written by Ritchie for the AP-3 minicomputer. The macro preprocessor operates as a text-replacement tool. It is employed to re-use text templates, typically in computer programming applications, but also in text editing and text-processing applications. Most users require m4 as a dependency of GNU autoconf.

  divert(-1)
  
  M4 has multiple output queues that can be manipulated with the
  `divert' macro. Valid queues range from 0 to 10, inclusive, with
  the default queue being 0.
  
  Calling the `divert' macro with an invalid queue causes text to be
  discarded until another call.  Note that even while output is being
  discarded, quotes around `divert' and other macros are needed to
  prevent expansion.
  
  # Macros aren't expanded within comments, meaning that keywords such
  # as divert and other built-ins may be used without consequence.
  
  # HTML utility macro:
  
  define(`H2_COUNT', 0)
  
  # The H2_COUNT macro is redefined every time the H2 macro is used:
  
  define(`H2',
  	`define(`H2_COUNT', incr(H2_COUNT))<h2>H2_COUNT. $1</h2>')

  dnl The dnl macro causes m4 to discard the rest of the line, thus
