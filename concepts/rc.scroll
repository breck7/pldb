  a <>b       # opens b as a's standard input and standard output

 summary rc (for "run commands") is the command line interpreter for Version 10 Unix and Plan 9 from Bell Labs operating systems. It resembles the Bourne shell, but its syntax is somewhat simpler. It was created by Tom Duff, who is better known for an unusual C programming language construct ("Duff's device"). A port of the original rc to Unix is part of Plan 9 from User Space.  A rewrite of rc for Unix-like operating systems by Byron Rakitzis is also available but includes some incompatible changes. Rc uses C-like control structures instead of ALGOL-like, as the original Bourne shell, except that it uses an if not construct instead of else and has a Bourne-like for loop to iterate over lists. In rc all variables are lists of strings, which eliminates the need for constructs like "$@".
