The pan configuration language allows the definition of machine configuration information and an associated schema with a simple, human-accessible syntax. A pan language compiler transforms the configuration information contained within a set of pan templates to a machine-friendly XML or JSON format. The pan language is used within the Quattor toolkit to define the desired configuration for one or more machines. Read more on Wikipedia...
