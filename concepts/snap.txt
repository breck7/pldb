Snap! is a free, blocks- and browser-based educational graphical programming language that allows students to create interactive animations, games, stories, and more, while learning about mathematical and computational ideas. Snap! was inspired by Scratch, but also targets both novice and more advanced students by including and expanding Scratch's features. Since version 4.0, it is entirely browser-based, with no software that needs to be installed on the local device, much like Scratch.. Read more on Wikipedia...
