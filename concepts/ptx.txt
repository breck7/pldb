Parallel Thread Execution (PTX, or NVPTX) is a pseudo-assembly language used in Nvidia's CUDA programming environment.  The nvcc compiler translates code written in CUDA, a C++-like language, into PTX, and the graphics driver contains a compiler which translates the PTX into a binary code which can be run on the processing cores..
