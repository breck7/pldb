Executable UML (xtUML or xUML) is both a software development method and a highly abstract software language. It was described for the first time in 2002 in the book "Executable UML: A Foundation for Model-Driven Architecture". The language "combines a subset of the UML (Unified Modeling Language) graphical notation with executable semantics and timing rules." The Executable UML method is the successor to the Shlaerâ€“Mellor method. Read more on Wikipedia...
