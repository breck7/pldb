COMIT was the first string processing language (compare SNOBOL, TRAC, and Perl), developed on the IBM 700/7000 series computers by Dr. Victor Yngve and collaborators at MIT from 1957 to 1965.  Yngve created the language for supporting computerized research in the field of linguistics, and more specifically, the area of machine translation for natural language processing.
