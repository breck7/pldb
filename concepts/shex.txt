Shape Expressions (ShEx)  is a language for validating and describing RDF.  It was proposed at the 2012 RDF Validation Workshop as a high-level, concise language for RDF validation.  The shapes can be defined in a human-friendly compact syntax called ShExC or using any Resource Description Framework (RDF) serialization formats like JSON-LD or Turtle. Read more on Wikipedia...
