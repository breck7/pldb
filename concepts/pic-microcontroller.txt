PIC (usually pronounced as "pick") is a family of microcontrollers made by Microchip Technology, derived from the PIC1650  originally developed by General Instrument's Microelectronics Division. The name PIC initially referred to Peripheral Interface Controller, then it was corrected as Programmable Intelligent Computer. The first parts of the family were available in 1976; by 2013 the company had shipped more than twelve billion individual parts, used in a wide variety of embedded systems. Read more on Wikipedia...
