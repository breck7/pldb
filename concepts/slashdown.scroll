     ## Slashdown is a superset of markdown.
 
     Using indentation and some simple syntax, you can hand write markup with more customizability and *dare I say* OOOMPH!
 
     It was designed for [HTMX](), [Tailwind](), and joy. In fact, this page has Tailwind's PlayCDN enabled â€“ go to town experimenting!
 
     ## The basics
 
     ### Any line that starts with a `/` is a tag.
     By default, it will render a div, but you can name it anything you want: `/section`, `/MyComponent`, `/x-thing`.
 
     ### Attributes can follow:
     `/button hx-post="/clicked" hx-swap="outerHTML"`
 
     #### Common shorthands for classes and IDs:
     `/section #hero .rounded.bg-gray-200.p-4`
 
     #### Stacking, for organization
 
 
     ### Text at the end
     At the end of a tag, you can add ` = ` followed by anything except line breaks. This will be treated as innerText for that tag.
     `/section #hero .rounded.bg-gray-200.p-4`
