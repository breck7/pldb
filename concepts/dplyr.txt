dplyr is a grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs that help you solve the most common data manipulation challenges: mutate() adds new variables that are functions of existing variables. select() picks variables based on their names. filter() picks cases based on their values. summarise() reduces multiple values down to a single summary. arrange() changes the ordering of the rows.
