 summary HP BASIC for OpenVMS is the latest name for a dialect of the BASIC programming language created by DEC (DEC) and now owned by Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE).  It was originally developed in the 1970s for the RSTS-11 operating system on the PDP-11 minicomputer.  It was later ported to OpenVMS, first on VAX, then Alpha, and most recently Integrity. Past names for the product include: BASIC-PLUS, Basic Plus 2 (BP2 or BASIC-Plus-2), VAX BASIC, DEC BASIC, and Compaq BASIC for OpenVMS.  Multiple variations of the titles noting the hardware platform (VAX, AlphaServer, etc.) also exist.
