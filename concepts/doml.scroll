example
 # Version 0.3
 // Construct a new Color
 Test = Color() {
   RGB = 255, 64, 128,
 }
 
 // Constructors do exist
 // the parameter names are purely for your own merit, they will check if its possible however (will be possible on most systems)
 TheSame = Color::Normalized(r: 1, g: 0.25, b: 0.5) {
   Name = "Bob"
 }
 
 // You can also just declare an object without scoping it
 Other = Color()
 Other.Name = "X"
 
 // You can declare random other values
 MyValue = 2
 
 // You can also edit the original Test at any point EITHER by doing
 Test.R = 50
 // Or by doing
 Test.{
   G = 128
 }
 
 // You can declare arrays like
 ArrayObject = []Color {
   ::Normalized(0.95, 0.55, 0.22){
     Name = "Other", // Trailing commas are always allowed
   },
   // You can still do an empty construction
   ::() {
     RGB = 50, 25, 125,
   },
   // And thus you can leave out the ::()
   {
     RGB = 50, 25, 125,
   },
 }
 
 // You can also copy objects by doing
 NewObj = Other
 
 // Or can do something like
 NewObj.Name = ArrayObject[0].Name
 
 // You can also declare arrays inside object definitions
 MyTags = Tags() {
   // Note: all have to be of the same type
   SetTags = ["Hello", "Other", "bits", "bobs", "kick"]
   Name = MyTags.GetTags[0] // And indexing them works like you would think
 }
 
 // You can declare dictionaries like
 // Dictionaries within objects can also be created similarly
 MyDictionary = [String : Color] {
   {
     "Bob" : Color::Normalized(0.5, 1.2, 3.5) {
       Name = "Bob's Color"
     }
   },
 }
 // No need to keep classes around in this example
 # Deinit all
