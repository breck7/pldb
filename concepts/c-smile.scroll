description C-SMILE is a scripting language, which inherits it's syntax and structure from C, C++, Java(tm) and JavaScript. On hypothetical "axis of programming languages" it resides somewhere between Java(tm) and JavaScript. In the same way as in JavaScript, all variables are typeless and as in Java it is mandatory to declare variables before usage. C-SMILE has a compiler, a virtual machine running bytecodes, and a C/C++ extensible runtime. C-SMILE is intended to run in standalone or embedded mode.
