THJSON looks almost exactly like HJSON - it is in fact a superset of HJSON, which itself is a superset of JSON. The extra bit is the addition of a class name in round brackets before a map (maps are objects that are enclosed in {} parentheses).

- thjson appears in categories: dataNotation
- thjson is developed on GitHub
- thjson is written in Java, Markdown, XML
