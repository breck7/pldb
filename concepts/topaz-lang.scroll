example
 ;; A comment
 ;; `Ven n a` represents lists that are `n` long, that contain `a`s
 ;; A Vec is either:
 type Vec (n: Uint) (a: Type) =
   ;; empty, with length 0...
   Nil: {a} -> Vec 0 a
   ;; or 1 item longer than a Vec of length n.
   `::`: {n a} -> a -> Vec n a -> Vec (n+1) a
 ;; `zip` should take two lists and return a list of pairs.
 ;; The two lists are required to be the same length because `n` is the same for
 ;; both parameters.
 let zip {n a b} (left: Vec n a) (right: Vec n b): Vec n (a, b) =
   match left, right in
     ;; Either both lists are empty...
     Nil,     Nil     => Nil
     ;; or they both contain at least one item.
     x :: xs, y :: ys => (x, y) :: zip xs ys
     ;; No other cases are needed, because the lists are the same length!
