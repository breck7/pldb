Joe-E is a subset of the Java programming language intended to support programming according to object-capability discipline.The language is notable for being an early object-capability subset language.  It has influenced later subset languages, such as ADsafe and Caja/Cajita, subsets of Javascript. It is also notable for allowing methods to be verified as functionally pure, based on their method signatures.The restrictions imposed by the Joe-E verifier include:  Classes may not have mutable static fields, because these create global state.
