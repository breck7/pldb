ProbeVue is IBM's implementation of a lightweight dynamic tracing environment introduced in AIX version 6.1. ProbeVue provides the ability to probe running processes in order to provide statistical analysis as well as retrieve data from the probed process. The dynamic nature of ProbeVue allows it to be used as a global system performance tool while retaining the ability to drill into very specific events on a single process or thread.
