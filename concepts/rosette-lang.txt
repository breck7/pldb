Rosette is a solver-aided programming language that extends Racket with language constructs for program synthesis, verification, and more. To verify or synthesize code, Rosette compiles it to logical constraints solved with off-the-shelf SMT solvers. By combining virtualized access to solvers with Racket’s metaprogramming, Rosette makes it easy to develop synthesis and verification tools for new languages.

; This implements a SAT solver.
