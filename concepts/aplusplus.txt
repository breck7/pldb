A++ stands for abstraction plus reference plus  synthesis which is used as a name for the minimalistic  programming language that is built on ARS. ARS is an abstraction from the Lambda Calculus, taking its three basic operations, and giving them a more general meaning, thus providing a foundation for the three major programming paradigms: functional programming, object-oriented programming and imperative programming. ARS Based Programming is used as a name for programming which consists mainly of applying patterns derived from ARS to programming in any language. Read more on Wikipedia...
