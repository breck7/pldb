LyX (styled as                                    L                                                                                                          Y                                                                             X                          {\displaystyle \mathbf {L} \!{}_{\mathbf {\displaystyle Y} }\!\mathbf {X} }   ; pronounced [ˈlɪks]) is an open source document processor based on the LaTeX typesetting system. Unlike most word processors, which follow the WYSIWYG ("what you see is what you get") paradigm, LyX has a WYSIWYM ("what you see is what you mean") approach, where what shows up on the screen is only an approximation of what will show up on the page. Since LyX largely functions as a front-end to the LaTeX typesetting system, it has the power and flexibility of LaTeX, and can handle documents including books, notes, theses, to academic papers, letters, etc. Read more on Wikipedia...
