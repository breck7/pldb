 summary Draco was a shareware programming language created by Chris Gray. First developed for CP/M sytems, Amiga version followed in 1987.Although Draco, a blend of Pascal and C, was well suited for general purpose programming, its uniqueness as a language was its main weak point. Gray used Draco for the Amiga to create a port of Peter Langston's game Empire.
