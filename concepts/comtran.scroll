 summary COMTRAN (COMmercial TRANslator) is an early programming language developed at IBM.  It was intended as the business programming equivalent of the scientific programming language FORTRAN (FORmula TRANslator).  It served as one of the forerunners to the COBOL language. Developed by Bob Bemer, in 1957, the language was the first to feature the programming language element known as a picture clause.
