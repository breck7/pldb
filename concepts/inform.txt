Include Trivial Extension by Andrew Plotkin.

Volume 1 - overview

Chapter - setting the scene

The Kitchen is a room.

[Comment: this kitchen is modelled after the one in Zork, although it lacks the detail to establish this to the player.]

Section - the kitchen table

The spicerack is a container in the Kitchen.

Table of Spices
Name Flavor
&quot;cinnamon&quot; 5
&quot;nutmeg&quot; 4
&quot;szechuan pepper&quot;  8

The description of the spicerack is &quot;It&#39;s mostly empty.&quot;

Chapter - a character

A purple cow called Gelett is in the Kitchen.

[This comment spans multiple lines..

...and this line contains [nested square[] brackets]...

...which is legal in Inform 7.]

Instead of examining Gelett:
 say &quot;You&#39;d rather see than be one.&quot;

Instead of examining Gelett:
 say &quot;You&#39;d rather see than be one.&quot;

Check smelling Gelett:
 say &quot;This text contains several lines.

A blank line is displayed as a paragraph break,
but a simple line break is not.&quot;;
 stop the action.

Section - cow catching

Gelett has a number called the mooness.

Instead of taking Gelett:
 increment the mooness of Gelett;
 if the mooness of Gelett is one:
   say &quot;Gelett moos once.&quot;;
 else:
   say &quot;Gelett moos [mooness of Gelett in words] times.&quot;;

Volume 2 - the turn cycle

Every turn:
 say &quot;A turn passes[one of][or] placidly[or] idly[or] tediously[at random].&quot;

&quot;Hello Deductible&quot; by &quot;I.F. Author&quot;

The story headline is &quot;An Interactive Example&quot;.

The Living Room is a room. &quot;A comfortably furnished living room.&quot;
The Kitchen is north of the Living Room.
The Front Door is south of the Living Room.
The Front Door is a door. The Front Door is closed and locked.

The insurance salesman is a man in the Living Room. The description is &quot;An insurance salesman in a tacky polyester suit. He seems eager to speak to you.&quot; Understand &quot;man&quot; as the insurance salesman.

A briefcase is carried by the insurance salesman. The description is &quot;A slightly worn, black briefcase.&quot;  Understand &quot;case&quot; as the briefcase.

The insurance paperwork is in the briefcase. The description is &quot;Page after page of small legalese.&quot; Understand &quot;papers&quot; or &quot;documents&quot; or &quot;forms&quot; as the paperwork.

Instead of listening to the insurance salesman:
	say &quot;The salesman bores you with a discussion of life  insurance policies.  From his briefcase he pulls some paperwork which he hands to you.&quot;;
	move the insurance paperwork to the player.
