 summary Joule is a concurrent dataflow programming language, designed for building distributed applications. It is so concurrent that the order of statements within a block is irrelevant to the operation of the block. Statements are executed whenever possible, based on their inputs. Everything in Joule happens by sending messages. There is no control flow. Instead, the programmer describes the flow of data, making it a dataflow programming language.   It is considered the precursor to the E programming language.
