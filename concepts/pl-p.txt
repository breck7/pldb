The PL/P programming language (an acronym of Programming Language for Prime (computers)) is a mid-level programming language developed by Prime Computer to serve as their second primary system programming language after Fortran IV.  PL/P was a subset of PL/I. Additions to the PRIMOS operating system for Prime 50 Series computers were written mostly in PL/P in later years. Read more on Wikipedia...
