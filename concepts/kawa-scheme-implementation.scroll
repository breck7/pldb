 summary Kawa  is a language framework written in the programming language Java that implements the programming language Scheme, a dialect of Lisp, and can be used to implement other languages to run on the Java virtual machine (JVM). It is a part of the GNU Project. The name Kawa comes from the Polish word for coffee; a play on words, since Java is another familiar name for coffee.
