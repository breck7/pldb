EOL is an imperative programming language for creating, querying and modifying EMF models. You can think of it as a mixture of Javascript and OCL, combining the best of both worlds. As such, it provides all the usual imperative features found in Javascript (e.g. statement sequencing, variables, for and while loops, if branches etc.) and all the nice features of OCL such as those handy collection querying functions.

var m : new Model;

m.name = &quot;m&quot;;

// Create five packages
for (i in 1.to(5)){
  var package : Package = new Package;
  package.name = &quot;p&quot; + i;
  package.package = m;

  // Create three classes in each package
  for (j in 1.to(3)) {
    
    var class : Class = new Class;
    class.name = &quot;c&quot; + i + &quot;&quot; + j;
    class.isAbstract = false;
    class.package = package;
    
  }
  
}

// Assign random supertypes to the classes created
for (c in Class.allInstances) {
  c.extends = Class.allInstances.random();
}
