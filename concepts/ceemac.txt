CEEMAC is a programming language developed in the 1980s for the Apple II family of computers.  It was authored by Brooke Boering and published by Vagabondo Enterprises,CEEMAC was designed to be a visual composition language in which the programmer designed dynamic "scores" by programatically controlling color, shape, sound and movement. Additionally, a programmer could then "perform" their score through use of the Apple II keyboard or paddle input devices to introduce additional variation.CEEMAC syntax loosely resembled a combination of BASIC and Pascal and include control commands such as GOTO, GOSUB, DO, AGAIN, FOR, SKIP, EXIT and loop control structures such as IF/WHILE and TIL/UNLESS.
