 summary SQLite ( or ) is a relational database management system contained in a C programming library. In contrast to many other database management systems, SQLite is not a clientâ€“server database engine. Rather, it is embedded into the end program. SQLite is ACID-compliant and implements most of the SQL standard, using a dynamically and weakly typed SQL syntax that does not guarantee the domain integrity. SQLite is a popular choice as embedded database software for local/client storage in application software such as web browsers. It is arguably the most widely deployed database engine, as it is used today by several widespread browsers, operating systems, and embedded systems (such as mobile phones), among others. SQLite has bindings to many programming languages.
