Checked C is an extension to C that lets programmers write C code that is guaranteed by the compiler to be type-safe.  The goal is to let people easily make their existing C code type-safe and eliminate entire classes of errors. Checked C does not address use-after-free errors. This repo has a wiki for Checked C, sample code, the specification, and test code.
