JAWS Scripting Language is a proprietary programming language that facilitates the interoperability of the JAWS for Windows screen reading program with practically any applicationâ€“both proprietary and off-the-shelf.  The JAWS Scripting Language, or JSL is a compiled language, allowing for source code protection.  "JAWS scripting" commonly also cumulatively refers to customization of JAWS through use of its built-in, user-editable utilities (called "Managers") or editing the configuration files directly, in combination with writing actual scripts.
