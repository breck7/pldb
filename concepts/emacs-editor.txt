Emacs  is a family of text editors that are characterized by their extensibility. The manual for the most widely used variant, GNU Emacs, describes it as "the extensible, customizable, self-documenting, real-time display editor".  Development of the first Emacs began in the mid-1970s, and work on its direct descendant, GNU Emacs, continues actively as of  2018. Read more on Wikipedia...
