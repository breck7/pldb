description A human readable quasi-concatenative programming language. Cognate is a small, dynamic, concatenative language for functional programming. Cognate aims to express complex programs in a simple and readable way through its unique syntax, which emphasises embedding comments into statements. This makes programs very readable and helps a programmer better express their intentions.

example
 ~~ Prime numbers in Cognate
 
 Def Factor (Zero? Modulo Swap);

 Def Primes (
    Let U is upper bound;
    initially List ();
    For Range 2 to U (
       Let P is potential prime;
       Let Found be list of found primes;
       Let To-check be Take-while (<= Sqrt P) Found;
       When All (Not Factor of P) To-check (
          Append P
       ) to Found
    )
 );
 
 Print Primes up to 1000;
