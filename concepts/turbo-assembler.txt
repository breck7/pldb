Turbo Assembler (TASM)  is a computer assembler (software for program development) developed by Borland which runs on and produces code for 16- or 32-bit x86 DOS or Microsoft Windows. It can be used with Borland's high-level language compilers, such as Turbo Pascal, Turbo Basic, Turbo C and Turbo C++. The Turbo Assembler package is bundled with the Turbo Linker, and is interoperable with the Turbo Debugger. Read more on Wikipedia...
