ObjectPAL is short for Object-Oriented Paradox Application Language, which is the programming language used by the Borland Paradox database application (now owned by Corel).  Paradox, now in its 11th version, is a constituent of Corel's Word Perfect X3 office suite, for 32-bit Microsoft Windows.  The language is tightly-bound to the application's forms, and provides a very rapid and robust development environment for creating database applications for Windows. Read more on Wikipedia...
