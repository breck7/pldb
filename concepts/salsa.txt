The SALSA programming language (Simple Actor Language System and Architecture) is an actor-oriented programming language that uses concurrency primitives beyond asynchronous message passing, including token-passing, join, and first-class continuations. It also supports distributed computing over the Internet with universal naming, remote communication, and migration linguistic abstractions and associated middleware. For portability, it produces Java code.. Read more on Wikipedia...
