 example
  The following tab indented lines will cause a true vi with modelines
  activated to infinitely loop putting "Hello World" in the buffer. Hit
   to abort the loop and see the output. None of the vi clones
  support modelines this powerful, and modelines are disabled by default.
  Set the environment variable EXINIT to "set ml" to activate modelines.
  
  	vi: $  y a :
  	vi: $-1y b :
  	vi: @b :
  	put a |@b
  	Hello World
  
  Whitespace is largely insignificant, but these must be the last five
  lines in the file to work properly. Unless it is in "vi: ... :" or
  "ex: ... :" format, any preceding text will be ignored.

 summary vi is a screen-oriented text editor originally created for the Unix operating system. The portable subset of the behavior of vi and programs based on it, and the ex editor language supported within these programs, is described by (and thus standardized by) the Single Unix Specification and POSIX.The original code for vi was written by Bill Joy in 1976, as the visual mode for a line editor called ex that Joy had written with Chuck Haley. Bill Joy's ex 1.1 was released as part of the first Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) Unix release in March 1978. It was not until version 2.0 of ex, released as part of Second BSD in May 1979 that the editor was installed under the name "vi" (which took users straight into ex's visual mode), and the name by which it is known today. Some current implementations of vi can trace their source code ancestry to Bill Joy; others are completely new, largely compatible reimplementations. The name "vi" is derived from the shortest unambiguous abbreviation for the ex command visual, which switches the ex line editor to visual mode. The name is sometimes pronounced  (as in the discrete English letters v and i) and sometimes to rhyme with bye.In addition to various nonâ€“free software variants of vi distributed with proprietary implementations of Unix, vi was opensourced with OpenSolaris, and several free and open source software vi clones exist. A 2009 survey of Linux Journal readers found that vi was the most widely used text editor among respondents, beating gedit, the second most widely used editor, by nearly a factor of two (36% to 19%).
