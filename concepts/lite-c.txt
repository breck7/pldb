Lite-C is a programming language for multimedia applications and personal computer games, using a syntax subset of the C language with some elements of the C++ language. Its main difference to C is the native implementation of multimedia and computer game related objects like sounds, images, movies, GUI elements, 2D and 3D models, collision detection and rigid body physics. Lite-C executables are compiled instead of interpreted. Read more on Wikipedia...

{
   level_load(&quot;&quot;); // open an empty level. you can use NULL instead of &quot;&quot;
   ENTITY* sphere = ent_create(&quot;sphere.mdl&quot;,vector(0,0,0),NULL); // create sphere model at position (0,0,0)
   while(1) {
      sphere-&gt;pan += 1; // rotate the sphere with 1 degree per frame
      wait(1);  // wait one frame
