  void main()
  {
     level_load(""); // open an empty level. you can use NULL instead of ""
     ENTITY* sphere = ent_create("sphere.mdl",vector(0,0,0),NULL); // create sphere model at position (0,0,0)
     while(1) {
        sphere->pan += 1; // rotate the sphere with 1 degree per frame

 summary Lite-C is a programming language for multimedia applications and personal computer games, using a syntax subset of the C language with some elements of the C++ language. Its main difference to C is the native implementation of multimedia and computer game related objects like sounds, images, movies, GUI elements, 2D and 3D models, collision detection and rigid body physics. Lite-C executables are compiled instead of interpreted. Lite-C runs on 32-bit and 64-bit Windows XP or Vista operating systems. Lite-C claims to allow very fast programming with a minimum of code, and easy access to non-programmers. For this, the developer provides a 25-lesson workshop that especially deals with the game and multimedia related objects of the language.  Lite-C supports the Windows API and the Component Object Model (COM); therefore OpenGL and DirectX programs can directly be written in lite-C. It has integrated the free A8 rendering engine.
