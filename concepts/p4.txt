P4 is a programming language designed to allow programming of packet forwarding planes. In contrast to a general purpose language such as C or Python, P4 is a domain-specific language with a number of constructs optimized around network data forwarding.  P4 is an open-source, permissively licensed language and is maintained by a non-profit organization called the P4 Language Consortium. Read more on Wikipedia...
