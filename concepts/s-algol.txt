S-algol (St Andrews Algol) is a computer programming language derivative of ALGOL 60 developed at the University of St Andrews in 1979 by Ron Morrison and Tony Davie. The language is a modification of ALGOL to contain orthogonal data types that Morrison created for his PhD thesis.  Morrison would go on to become professor at the university and head of the department of computer science. Read more on Wikipedia...

! Comments are introduced by an exclamation point and continue until end of line.

! The let keyword introduces declarations of constants and variables
! Identifiers start with an alphabetic character followed by alphanumeric characters or the full stop (.)
! An initial value must be given, and this determines the data type of declaration

let width := 10                   ! := sets the value of a variable, this is an int
