LES is an interchange format for syntax trees, comparable to s-expressions but designed for languages in the Algol family such as C, C++, C#, Java, EcmaScript, Rust and Python. It can be described as “JSON for code”: just as XML/YAML/JSON are tree structures that assign no particular meaning to the data inside, likewise LES represents syntax trees without assigning any particular meaning to them.
