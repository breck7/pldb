QUEL is a relational database query language, based on tuple relational calculus, with some similarities to SQL.  It was created as a part of the Ingres DBMS effort at University of California Berkeley, based on Codd's earlier suggested but not implemented Data Sub-Language ALPHA.  QUEL was used for a short time in most products based on the freely available Ingres source code, most notably in an implementation called POSTQUEL supported by POSTGRES. Read more on Wikipedia...
