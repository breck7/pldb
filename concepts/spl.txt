Structured Product Labeling (SPL) is a Health Level Seven International (HL7) standard which defines the content of human prescription drug labeling in an XML format.  The "drug label" includes all published material accompanying a drug, such as the actual label on a prescribed dose as well as the package insert which contains a great deal of detailed information about the drug.  As of Release 4 of the SPL standard, 22,000 FDA informational product inserts have been encoded according to the standard.SPL documents contain both the content of labeling (all text, tables and figures) for a product along with additional machine readable information (drug listing data elements).
