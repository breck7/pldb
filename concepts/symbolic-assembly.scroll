 summary The Symbolic Assembly Program (SAP) is an assembler program for the IBM 704 computer. It was written by Roy Nutt at United Aircraft Corporation, and was distributed by the SHARE user's group beginning in 1956 as the Share Assembly Program. SAP succeeded an earlier program called NYAP1 (New York Assembly Program 1), which it closely resembled, and became the standard assembler for 704 users. It "set the external form of an assembly language that was to be a model for all its successors and which persists almost unchanged to the present day."
