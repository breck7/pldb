Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR, pronounced "fire") is a draft standard describing data formats and elements (known as "resources") and an application programming interface (API) for exchanging electronic health records. The standard was created by the Health Level Seven International (HL7) health-care standards organization. FHIR builds on previous data format standards from HL7, like HL7 version 2.x and HL7 version 3.x. Read more on Wikipedia...
