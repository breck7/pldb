@defmodulelang[scribble/manual]{The @racketmodname[scribble/manual]
language provides all of @racketmodname[scribble/base] plus many
additional functions that are specific to writing Racket
documentation. It also associates @tech{style properties} with the
generated @racket[doc] export to select the default Racket manual
style for rendering; see @secref[&quot;manual-render-style&quot;] for more
information.

The @racketmodname[scribble/manual] name can also be used as a library
with @racket[require], in which case it provides all of the same
bindings, but without setting the reader or setting the default
rendering format to the Racket manual format.}
