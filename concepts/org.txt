Org-mode (also: Org mode; ) is a document editing, formatting, and organizing mode, designed for notes, planning, and authoring within the free software text editor Emacs. The name is used to encompass plain text files ("org files") that include simple marks to indicate levels of a hierarchy (such as the outline of an essay, a topic list with subtopics, nested computer code, etc.), and an editor with functions that can read the markup and manipulate hierarchy elements (expand/hide elements, move blocks of elements, check off to-do list items, etc.). Org-mode was created by Carsten Dominik in 2003, originally to organize his own life and work, and since the first release numerous other users and developers have contributed to this free software package.

* Motivation

  The dominant simple plain-text markup languages for the web are
  Textile and Markdown. A factor for the popularity of those markup
  formats is the widespread availability of simple, free packages for
  converting the formats to HTML. For example, the world of
  Ruby-powered websites has settled on RedCloth for converting Textile
  to HTML.

  The default way to convert org-mode files to HTML is the powerful
  publishing functionality provided by =emacs=. However, =emacs= does
  not easiliy integrate into many existing website frameworks.

  =Org-ruby= tries to make it easier to use org-mode files in both
  dyanmic and static website generation tools written in
  Ruby. =Org-ruby= is a simple Ruby gem to convert org-mode files to
  HTML.

* Using Org-ruby

  =Org-ruby= follows the same model as other Ruby markup
  libraries. You install the gem:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  sudo gem install org-ruby
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  Then, to convert an org-file to HTML in your Ruby code:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  require &#39;rubygems&#39;
  require &#39;org-ruby&#39;

  data = IO.read(filename)
  puts Orgmode::Parser.new(data).to_html
  #+END_EXAMPLE

* Walkthrough: Using org-ruby with Webby

  Here is an example of how to integrate =org-ruby= into Webby, a
  static website generation tool written in Ruby.

  Webby follows a similar pattern to other static site generation
  tools (like nanoc, Jekyll, and webgen):

  - You author website content in text with simple markup
  - Each page is fed through one or more /filters/ to produce HTML
  - The HTML is mixed in with layouts to produce the final pages

  For a Webby site, a the source for a page may look like this:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ---
  title:           Special Directories
  created_at:      2009-12-17
  status:          Complete
  filter:
    - erb
    - maruku
  tags:
    - powershell
  ---
  &lt;%= @page.title %&gt;
  ==================

  Special Directories are a set of directories, each of which has a
  function that will navigate you to the appropriate directory using
  the push-location cmdlet. For example, the function `home` might
  navigate to `c:\users\bdewey.`

  Install
  -------

  Copy the module to somewhere in `ENV:PSModulePath`. Then,

      InstallModule SpecialDirectories
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  In the above example, the text is written in Markdown. At the top of
  the file, metadata informs Webby to pass the text through two
  /filters/ to produce HTML. The first filter, =erb=, handles embedded
  Ruby. In this case, it will replace ~&lt;%= @page.title %&gt;~ with the
  page title (=Special Directories=). The second filter uses Maruku to
  translate Markdown into HTML.

  You can use the exact same pattern to include org-mode files in a
  Webby site. For this walkthrough, I assume you already have Webby
  installed, and that you&#39;ve already created a site.

  1. Make sure you have =org-ruby= installed: =sudo gem install
     org-ruby=.
  2. You need to register a new Webby filter to handle org-mode
     content. Webby makes this easy. In the =lib/= folder of your
     site, create a file =orgmode.rb=:

     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     require &#39;org-ruby&#39;

     Webby::Filters.register :org do |input|
       Orgmode::Parser.new(input).to_html
     end
     #+END_EXAMPLE

     This code creates a new filter, =org=, that will use the
     =org-ruby= parser to translate org-mode input into HTML.
  3. Create your content. For example:

     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
---
title:              Orgmode Parser
created_at:         2009-12-21
status:             Under development
filter:
  - erb
  - org
tags:
  - orgmode
  - ruby
---
&lt;%= @page.title %&gt;

  Status: &lt;%= @page.status %&gt;

* Description

  Helpful Ruby routines for parsing orgmode files. The most
  significant thing this library does today is convert orgmode files
  to textile. Currently, you cannot do much to customize the
  conversion. The supplied textile conversion is optimized for
  extracting &quot;content&quot; from the orgfile as opposed to &quot;metadata.&quot;

* History

** 2009-12-29: Version 0.4

   - The first thing output in HTML gets the class &quot;title&quot;
   - HTML output is now indented
   - Proper support for multi-paragraph list items.

     See? This paragraph is part of the last bullet.

   - Fixed bugs:
     - &quot;rake spec&quot; wouldn&#39;t work on Linux. Needed &quot;require &#39;rubygems&#39;&quot;.
       #+END_EXAMPLE

     This file will go through the =erb= and =org= filters; as defined
     in the previous step, the =org= filter will use =org-ruby= to
     generate HTML.

  That&#39;s all there is to it!
