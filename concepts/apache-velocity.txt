Apache Velocity is a Java-based template engine that provides a template language to reference objects defined in Java code. It aims to ensure clean separation between the presentation tier and business tiers in a Web application (the model–view–controller design pattern). Velocity is an open source software project hosted by the Apache Software Foundation. Read more on Wikipedia...
