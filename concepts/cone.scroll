description Acorn2's passion is the 3D web and his <a href='http://web3d.jondgoodwin.com/'>Pegasus3D</a> browser, and the web is powered by languages. His <a href='https://github.com/jondgoodwin/cone'>Cone</a> language powers the 3D web. Cone is statically-typed, and uses LLVM to generate native efficient executables. Cone will also be a test bed for implementing gradual memory management. His previous work, <a href='http://web3d.jondgoodwin.com/acorn/index.html'>Acorn</a> is a dynamic language with some of the same features.
