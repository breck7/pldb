Blitz BASIC refers to the programming language dialect that was interpreted by the first Blitz compilers, devised by New Zealand-based developer Mark Sibly. Being derived from BASIC, Blitz syntax was designed to be easy to pick up for beginners first learning to program.  The languages are game-programming oriented but are often found general-purpose enough to be used for most types of application. Read more on Wikipedia...
