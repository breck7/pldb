 summary FpgaC is a compiler for a subset of the C programming language, which produces digital circuits that will execute the compiled programs. The circuits may use FPGAs or CPLDs as the target processor for reconfigurable computing, or even ASICs for dedicated applications.  FpgaC's goal is to be an efficient High Level Language (HLL) for reconfigurable computing, rather than a Hardware Description Language (HDL) for building efficient custom hardware circuits.
