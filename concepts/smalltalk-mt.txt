Smalltalk MT is an implementation of the Smalltalk programming language created in 1994 by Tarik Kerroum to deal with some of the shortcomings of Smalltalk-80 style of implementations. Smalltalk MT adopts a different approach in that the Smalltalk source is compiled to machine code before being executed. This allows the developer the freedom of working with compiled code without the need for the traditional compile-link-run cycle. Read more on Wikipedia...
