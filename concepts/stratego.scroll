 summary Stratego/XT is a language and toolset for constructing stand-alone program transformation systems.  It combines the Stratego transformation language with the XT toolset of transformation components, providing a framework for constructing stand-alone program transformation systems. The Stratego language is based on a programming paradigm called strategic term rewriting. It provides rewrite rules for expressing basic transformation steps. The application of these rules can be controlled using strategies, a form of subroutines. The XT toolset provides reusable transformation components and declarative languages for deriving new components, such as parsing grammars using the Modular Syntax Definition Formalism (SDF) and implementing pretty-printing.
