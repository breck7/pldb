 summary This article is about the language for Atari 8-bit computers. Not to be confused with Borland's unrelated Turbo Basic.Turbo-Basic XL is an advanced version of BASIC for the Atari 8-bit family of home computers. It is a compatible superset of the Atari BASIC that was built-in to most Atari machines of the era. Turbo-Basic XL's most notable feature was vastly improved execution speed. An Atari BASIC program loaded into Turbo-BASIC, with no changes made, would generally run about three times as fast. A Turbo-Basic XL compiler was also available that created binary executables, further speeding up program performance to about ten times faster than Atari BASIC. Turbo-Basic XL was developed by Frank Ostrowski and published in the December 1985 issue of German computer magazine Happy Computer. A version for the 400/800 models was released shortly after, known as Frost Basic 1.4.
