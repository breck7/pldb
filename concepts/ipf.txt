:p.
The manatee has a broad flat tail and two flipper
like forelegs.  There are no back legs.
The manatee&#39;s large upper lip is split in two and
can be used like fingers to place food into the
mouth.  Bristly hair protrudes from its lips,
and almost buried in its hide are small eyes, with
which it can barely see.
