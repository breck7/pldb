CaPSL is a printer command language/page description language used by early Canon printers including the LBP-8III series and supported on (at least) LBP-8IV printers. This language was discontinued, with later Canon printers implementing PCL. It was also called LIPS or LIPS4. Read more on Wikipedia...
