The Actor programming language was invented by Charles Duff of The Whitewater Group in 1988. It was an offshoot of some object-oriented extensions to the Forth language he had been working on. Actor would be categorized as a pure object-oriented language in the style of Smalltalk. Read more on Wikipedia...
