Inspired by lit-html and HTM, and referencing the fantastically precise HTML5 spec, we built hypertext literal: a tagged template literal for HTML which interpolates values based on context, allowing automatic escaping and the interpolation of non-serializable values, such as event listeners, style objects, and other DOM nodes.

- Tags: template language, library
- HTL is developed on GitHub
- HTL is written in HTML, JavaScript, JSON, Markdown, YAML

html`&lt;span style=&quot;background: ${&quot;yellow; font-style: italic&quot;};&quot;&gt;Itâ€™s yellow (and italic).&lt;/span&gt;`
