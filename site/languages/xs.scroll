* XS is a Perl foreign function interface through which a program can call a C or C++ subroutine. XS or xsub is an abbreviation of "eXternal Subroutine", where external refers to programming languages external to Perl. XS also refers to a glue language for specifying calling interfaces supporting such interfaces (see below).. Read more on Wikipedia...

 /*
  * Notes on memory management
  *
  * - A pointer to the Perl SV representing a node is stored in the
  *   user data slot of `struct cmark_node`, so there&#39;s a 1:1 mapping
  *   between Perl and C objects.
  * - Every node SV keeps a reference to the parent SV. This is done
  *   indirectly by looking up the parent SV and increasing its refcount.
  * - This makes sure that a document isn&#39;t freed if the last reference
  *   from Perl to the root node is dropped, as references to child nodes
  *   might still exist.
  * - As a consequence, as long as a node is referenced from Perl, all its
  *   ancestor nodes will also be associated with a Perl object.
