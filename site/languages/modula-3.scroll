* Modula-3 is a programming language conceived as a successor to an upgraded version of Modula-2 known as Modula-2+. While it has been influential in research circles (influencing the designs of languages such as Java, C#, and Python) it has not been adopted widely in industry. It was designed by Luca Cardelli, James Donahue, Lucille Glassman, Mick Jordan (before at the Olivetti Software Technology Laboratory), Bill Kalsow and Greg Nelson at the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) Systems Research Center (SRC) and the Olivetti Research Center (ORC) in the late 1980s.

 (* The RdClass interface is analogous to the WrClass interface. It
 reveals that every reader contains a buffer of characters together
 with methods for managing the buffer.  New reader classes are created
 by importing RdClass (to gain access to the buffer and the methods)
 and then defining a subclass of Rd.T whose methods provide the new
 class&#39;s behavior.  The opaque type Private hides irrelevant details of
 the class-independent code. *)

 (* Let rd be a reader, abstractly given by len(rd), src(rd), cur(rd),
 avail(rd), closed(rd), seekable(rd), and intermittent(rd).  The data
 fields cur, closed, seekable, and intermittent in the object represent
 the corresponding abstract attributes of rd.  The buff, st, lo, and hi
 fields represent a buffer that contains part of src(rd), the rest of
 which is represented in some class-specific way. 
 
 More precisely, we say that the state of the representation is valid
 if conditions V1 through V4 hold:
 
 V1. the characters of buff in the range [st .. st+(hi-lo)] accurately 
     reflect src.  That is,  for all i in [rd.lo .. rd.hi-1],
            
 	rd.buff[rd.st + i - rd.lo] = src(rd)[i]
 
 V2. the cur field is in or just past the end of the occupied part of the 
     buffer, that is:
 
         rd.lo &lt;= rd.cur &lt;= rd.hi
 
 V3. the reader does not claim to be both intermittent and seekable:
 
 	NOT (rd.intermittent AND rd.seekable)
 
 It is possible that buff = NIL in a valid state, since the range of
 i&#39;s in V1 may be empty; for example, in case lo = hi.
 
 V4. if closed(rd) then rd.buff = NIL AND rd.lo = rd.hi
 
 If rd is valid and cur(rd) is less than rd.hi, we say the reader
 is ready.  More precisely, rd is ready if:
 
    NOT rd.closed  AND  rd.buff # NIL  AND  rd.lo &lt;= rd.cur &lt; rd.hi
 
 If the state is ready, then Rd.GetChar can be implemented by fetching
 from the buffer.  Together V1, V2, and V4 imply that if rd.cur # rd.hi
 then rd.buff # NIL and NOT rd.closed.  Therefore a valid reader is ready
 if &quot;rd.cur # rd.hi&quot;.
 
 The class-independent code modifies rd.cur, but no other variables
 revealed in this interface (except that &quot;Rd.Close&quot; modifies &quot;rd.lo&quot; and
 &quot;rd.cur&quot; and sets &quot;rd.buff&quot; to NIL in order to maintain invariant V4).  The
 class-independent code locks the reader before calling any methods.
 
 Here are the specifications for the methods:
 
 The basic purpose of the seek method is to make the reader ready.  To
 seek to a position n, the class-independent code checks whether the reader
 would be ready with rd.cur = n and if so, simply sets rd.cur to n.
 If not, it calls rd.seek supplying the position n as argument.
 As in the case of writers, the seek method can be called even for an
 unseekable reader in the special case of advancing to the next buffer.
 
 The fields with names beginning with &quot;Unget&quot; describe a buffer of characters 
 retained in case they need to be reused by UngetChar.  The fields with names 
 beginning with &quot;Waiting&quot; are a buffer once supplied by class-dependent code
 but temporarily suspended while characters originally saved in the unget 
 and then ungotten are being returned.  If NIL#Ungetbuff=buff, we are accessing
 previously ungotten characters from Ungetbuff^, and Waitingbuff is the buffer 
 most recently provided by seek.  Otherwise, buff is the buffer most recently
 provided by seek.  Either way, the fast path in class-independent code for 
 getting characters works the same, using buff, st, lo, and hi, as in the 
 earlier implementation, and ignoring the other buffer fields.  
 
 Similarly, (class-dependent) seek method bodies use only these same fields.  
 Only UngetChar and class-independent code surrounding seek method calls need
 be aware of the additional two buffer pointers and their subscripts.        
 
 There is a wrinkle to support the implementation of CharsReady.  If rd
 is ready, the class-independent code can handle the call to
 CharsReady(rd) without calling any methods (since there is at least
 one character ready in the buffer), but if rd.cur = rd.hi, then the
 class independent code needs to find out from the class implementation
 whether any characters are ready in the next buffer.  Using the seek
 method to advance to the next buffer won&#39;t do, since this could block,
 and CharsReady isn&#39;t supposed to block.  Therefore, the seek method
 takes a boolean argument saying whether blocking is allowed. If
 blocking is forbidden and the next buffer isn&#39;t ready, the method
 returns the special value WouldBlock; this allows the
 class-independent code to return zero from CharsReady.  The &quot;dontBlock&quot;
 boolean should be &quot;TRUE&quot; only if the seek method is being used to advance
 to the next buffer.
 
 More precisely, given a valid state where
 
      (n # rd.hi) =&gt; rd.seekable
 AND  (dontBlock =&gt; n = rd.hi)
 
 the call res := rd.seek(n, dontBlock) establishes a valid state.
 Furthermore, if res = Ready then rd is ready and rd.cur = n;
 while if res = Eof, then rd.cur = len(rd); and finally if res = WouldBlock
 then dontBlock was TRUE and avail(rd) = cur(rd).
 
 The getSub method is used to implement Rd.GetSub and is
 called with the reader lock held and the reader not closed.  Efficient 
 implementations override this method to avoid unnecessary copying by reading 
 directly from the reader source, bypassing the reader buffer.  The default
 implementation is correct for any class, but always copies through
 the reader buffer.
 
 The length method returns the length of a non-intermittent reader.
 That is: Given a valid state in which rd.intermittent is FALSE, the
 call rd.length() returns len(rd) without changing the state of rd.  An
 intermittent reader may return the length if it is known, or -1.
 
 The close method releases all resources associated with rd.  The exact
 meaning of this is class-specific.  &quot;Rd.Close&quot; sets the &quot;buff&quot; field
 to &quot;NIL&quot;, so the method need not do this.  When the method is 
 called the state will be valid; validity is not required when the 
 method returns (since after it returns, the class-independent code 
 will set the closed bit in the reader, which makes the rest of 
 the state irrelevant).
 
 The remainder of the interface is similar to the corresponding part 
 of the WrClass interface: *)
 
 PROCEDURE Init(rd: Rd.T); 
 (* Class-independent initialize rd, including private fields revealed herein. *)
 
 PROCEDURE Lock(rd: Rd.T) RAISES {};
 (* The reader rd must be unlocked; lock it and make its state valid. *)
 
 PROCEDURE Unlock(rd: Rd.T) RAISES {};
 (* The reader rd must be locked and valid; unlock it and restore the
 private invariant of the reader implementation. *)
 
 PROCEDURE GetSubDefault(rd: Rd.T; VAR (*OUT*) str: ARRAY OF CHAR): CARDINAL
   RAISES {Failure, Alerted};
   (* rd is locked and not closed. *)
 (* Implement &quot;getSub&quot; by copying from the buffer, calling the &quot;seek&quot;
    method as necessary.  Clients can override this in order to
    achieve greater efficiency; for example, by copying directly
    from the source of the reader into &quot;str&quot;. *)
 
 PROCEDURE LengthDefault(rd: Rd.T): INTEGER RAISES {Failure, Alerted};
 (* The procedure LengthDefault causes a checked runtime error; this
 represents an error in the (non-intermittent) class implementation. *)
 
 PROCEDURE CloseDefault(rd: Rd.T) RAISES {Failure, Alerted};
 (* The procedure CloseDefault is a no-op. *)
 
 END RdClass.
