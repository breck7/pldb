subsection Terms

* Sponsor a fact(s) and PLDB will prioritize research into this language or column type. When the new facts are published, we ask that you send payment (at the moment we ask that you monitor your sponsored page as we don't have an automated way to alert you when the new facts are published yet). If you are not 100% satisfied with the facts we publish, no payment is required.
