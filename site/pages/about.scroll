Welcome to PLDB: a Programming Language Database!

PLDB is a comprehensive database of programming languages and their features. The focus is on *programming languages*, but the database also includes other languages and entities one degree away--from popular high level plain text formats to binary specifications and beyond.

PLDB is for two groups of people:
1. *Programming language creators.* PLDB is organized big data to help you create great new languages, and improve existing ones. When making design decisions, quickly look up what features other languages have tried. Benefit from the experiences of thousands that have built languages before you. If you are researching something and can't find what you need here, open an issue and explain what you need.

2. *Programming language users.* PLDB provides a data-driven view of the programming language universe, to demystify the world of programming languages for you, and provide sound strategic and tactical advice to help you in your projects and your career. If you have a question not answered by the data here, open an issue and explain what you need.

## Cloc Stats
Below are the cloc stats for the pldb repo as of BUILT_ON_DAY.

bash cd ..; cd ..; cloc --quiet --vcs git . --read-lang-def=code/clocLangs.txt

# Mirrors
The URL for the official PLDB site is https://pldb.com. DNS will take that domain name and send your browser an IPv4 address. Your browser will send a request to that address which will reach our virtual server running Node.js (nicknamed _Marconi_) running in a Digital Ocean datacenter. _Marconi_ will send you the HTML, CSS, Javascript, PNGs, SVGs and JSON that make up the built website.
 link ../rows/url.html URL
 link ../rows/dns.html DNS
 link ../rows/ipv4.html IPv4

In case there's a problem with _Marconi_, you should be able to access the exact same site locally by downloading the source from GitHub.

If _Marconi_ AND GitHub were to go down at the same time...well that's why it's good to regularly download the entire source code of the site to your own machine! You can do that with:

bashCode
 git clone https://github.com/breck7/pldb.git
 # Then to keep it updated:
 cd pldb
 git pull

The site owes its existence to a kind (_but firm_) Internet commenter who told Breck Yunits to "learn to research properly" if he wanted to make his languages any good.
