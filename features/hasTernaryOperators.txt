Ternary operators
=================

let i = true ? 1 : 0

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(void) { printf(&quot;%d&quot;, 1 ? 1 : 0); }

print(1 if 1 else 0)

&lt;?php echo 1 ? 1 : 0;

// Since if statements are expressions
println(if (true) true else false)

int foo = x ? 1 : 0;

(set y (? (= x 0) 1 2))

while
 printline (1,0)(random[]&gt;0.5)
