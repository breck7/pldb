title What is the growth in programming languages over time?

import standardPostHeader.scroll

* As I build up my database of programming languages I hope to be able to answer questions like:
 dateline

- is the rate of new language creation accelerating, slowing down, or constant?
- what spurs the creation of new programming languages?
- can we predict how many new languages will be released next year? in 5 years? in 10 years?

* At the moment I am tracking 533 computer languages and I currently have creation years for more than half of those, including for 271 of the most popular ones.

* Here is a simple line graph of the cumulative number of languages I have by year.

* I will wait until I have more data to do more serious analysis (for example: the dip in the growth rate toward the end is likely due to my incomplete dataset and not indicative of a trend change).

* But until I can provide a more comprehensive analysis, I thought I'd share my first look.

* Update (12/10/2017): a number of readers have pointed out that some of the languages on this list are not programming languages. Future posts like this will be sure to exclude those.

* Data used in this article as csv:
