* Each programming language was created in a place (or perhaps, in a set of distributed places) and I am attempting to collect that data.
 dateline

* Currently I have the country of birth for about 260 of the over 1,000 languages I track.

* In my data so far, the US has birthed more languages than all other countries combined.

* After the U.S. comes the UK, Canada, France, and Switzerland, in that order.

* There could be bias in my dataset, of course, as I haven't yet added country for most languages. Things will clarify as the database continues to mature.
