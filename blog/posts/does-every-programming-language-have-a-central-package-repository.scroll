title Does every programming language have a central package repository?

aftertext
 Like millions of other programmers, every day I depend on
 central package repositories (CR) like npm, PyPI
 and CRAN.

paragraph
 The other day I was curious: does every programming
 language have one of these? I decided to find out. I
 pointed my crawler and trained a model to check for a
 package repository for every one of the 3,006 languages I
 am tracking. The results surprised me.

section ★ Only 1% have them

endSnippet

paragraph
 My model found only 39 languages with central package
 repositories. (For comparison, Wikipedia lists ~20). That's
 just ~1% of languages. I thought it would be higher.

section ★ ~30% of the Top 100 have them

paragraph
 Given that a programming language is very popular and
 appears in my top 100 list, it is about 15 - 30x more
 likely to have a CR. Given a language is not in the top
 100, <1% will have a CR.

section ★ 2 Million+ Packages Total

paragraph
 There are over 2,000,000 packages (aka modules or
 libraries) across these CRs. That means there are about
 1,000x more packages than there are programming languages.

paragraph
 With that many packages, name collision is certainly a
 problem (maybe a subject for another post), though not as
 much of a problem as in the domain system where
 130,000,000+ ".coms" alone are registered.

section ★ The top 5 account for ~80% of all packages

aftertext
 At over 900,000, Javascript's npm has almost more packages
 than all other CRs combined. Javascript, Java, PHP, Perl,
 and Python account for about 80% of packages.
 https://npmjs.org npm

section ★ GitHub has over 100,000,000 repositories

paragraph
 Given the size of GitHub, and it's growth as somewhat of a
 universal central package repository (though totally
 unmoderated), and given that many (if not the majority) of
 the packages in these CRs are also listed on GitHub, it's
 conceivable that GitHub is the largest CR and that the
 number of packages out there is easily 10x bigger than 2M.

section ★ Newer languages are not more likely to have CRs

paragraph
 This surprised me. The median age of a language with a CR
 is 24 (1995). Of the top 5 languages I mentioned above, all
 were created by then. Almost always the creation of the CR
 follows the launch of the language, sometimes by months or
 sometimes by years. I expected most CRs to be from newer
 languages, but that wasn't the case. While some new
 languages like Rust and Julia have CRs, others like Go and
 Kotlin do not.

section ★ The List

aftertext
 Here's my list of the main central package repositories for
 languages that have them. I cut the list a bit to only
 include CRs with more than 100 packages available. As
 always, open an issue if you spot any omissions or mistakes!

paragraph
 Notes: as Jay18001 pointed out, a few of these repositories
 serve packages for more than one language. Cocoapods =>
 Objective-C, and Nuget => F# and other .Net langs. In this
 post I collapsed things so each repo only has 1 language.

 Update: 8/26/2019. Multiple readers pointed out that my
 stat for Ruby was off by 10x. I used the # I found on this
 page, which turned out to be
 just the gems beginning with the letter A. I apologize for
 the mistake and am very grateful for the corrections.
