 I have done many problems on Project Euler but I've
 never participated in competitive programming.
 The other day I got curious, what does the competitive programming landscape look like?

 I started my quest by watching a great interview with a competitive programmer. Then
 I did some searching. Below are my results.

section Gennady Korotkevich

 I came across one interesting stat in my research. Gennady Korotkevich is a programmer who is currently the highest rated programmer on <i>all</i> 5 of the major competitive programming sites!

section Future work

aftertext
 It would be interesting to see trends in the number of
 participants and prize amounts in these competitions over
 time. I'm curious if eSports
 with prizes in the millions, will sap people away from
 programming competitions.
