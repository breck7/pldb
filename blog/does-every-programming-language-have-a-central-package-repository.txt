Does every programming language have a central package repository?
==================================================================

Like millions of other programmers, every day I depend on central package repositories (CR) like npm, PyPI and CRAN.
 https://npmjs.org
 https://pypi.python.org
 https://cran.r-project.org

The other day I was curious: does every programming language have one of these? I decided to find out. I pointed my crawler and trained a model to check for a package repository for every one of the 3,006 languages I am tracking. The results surprised me.

***

★ Only 1% have them
===================

My model found only 39 languages with central package repositories. (For comparison, Wikipedia lists ~20). That's just ~1% of languages. I thought it would be higher.

★ ~30% of the Top 100 have them
===============================

Given that a programming language is very popular and appears in my top 100 list, it is about 15 - 30x more likely to have a CR. Given a language is not in the top 100,  Objective-C, and Nuget => F# and other .Net langs. In this post I collapsed things so each repo only has 1 language.

Update: 8/26/2019. Multiple readers pointed out that my stat for Ruby was off by 10x. I used the # I found on this page, which turned out to be just the gems beginning with the letter A. I apologize for the mistake and am very grateful for the corrections.
