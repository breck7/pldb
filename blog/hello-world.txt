Welcome to PLDB: a Programming Language Database!

The goal of this site is to build a comprehensive database of programming languages and their common features.

This site is for two types of people:

1. *Programming language creators.* PLDB is organized big data to help you create great new languages, and improve existing ones. When making design decisions, quickly look up what features other languages have tried. Benefit from the experiences of thousands that have built languages before you. If you are researching something and can't find what you need here, you can add it and send a pull request, or share your request on Twitter.
