* Before GitHub started in 2008, the source code for nascent programming languages was stored in a variety of places. In the early days it was physical media; later on it was publicly accessible servers; and even later it started moving to online source control systems like self-hosted SVN servers or Sourceforce.

* But nowadays new language creation happens on GitHub more than anywhere else. Of the 44 languages created in 2008 that I track, 7% were put on GitHub that same year. Last year it was over 50%.

* This does not include languages that were created and then moved their source control to GitHub a year or more after their creation. I wanted to know, if you are starting a language, should you create the GitHub project right away? According to the data that is the popular thing to do.

* In the future I hope to refine this list to include factors such as whether the language has an origin community and how that affects things. I also hope to add more missing languages to the database, as always.

* Data used for this chart:
