Is it too late to create a popular programming language after age 40? Let's find out!

I computed an "ageAtCreation" column for 185 programming languages in the PLDB.

36 median age
37.5 avg age
16 min age
70 max age

Programming Language Creation Peaks In Your 30's
================================================
[Image Omitted]
 Programmers create the most languages in their 30's. Programmers in their 40's create the second most. After that it drops off fast.

Conclusion
==========

TypeScript, Go, JSON, and Clojure are a handful of very popular Top 100 languages that were created by people after age 40.

If you are under 55, it is not unprecedented to create a popular programming language.
