How often do you pair program?

For me the answer is *not enough*.

Much of my programming knowledge I got sitting behind coders at work in Redmond, San Francisco, Mountain View, et cetera.

I learned from programmers older than me, younger than me, and my contemporaries.

All groups used brilliant tools, commands, and DSLs I had never seen before.

PLDB is a remote, decentralized open source project, so it is very rare that any of us contributors get to "pair program" with each other.

Luckily, screencasts with video overlays turn out to be a good substitute for in person pair programming.

With that introduction, I present the video below.
