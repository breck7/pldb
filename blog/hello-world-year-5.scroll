I started PLDB 1,681 days ago(~4.5 years). After a big lull, I am excited to announce the new release!

- all source code for the site and database is now on GitHub.
- the database went from 3,800 to 4,266 entries.
- there are now pages listing the top 100 languages, top 250 languages, and languages by origin community.
- each language page now lists all fields.
- the site now runs on Scroll instead of Jekyll.

* I am excited to have this release behind me and hope to get more data, more crawling scripts, and more analysis up over the next few months. Thanks for reading!
