title A New Word: Leet Sheets

import standardPostHeader.scroll

Today we introduce a new noun to the English Language: "Leet Sheet".

A Leet Sheet is a document that fits on a single piece of paper and is intelligently designed to communicate the most important concepts about a topic.

PLDB now has links to Leet Sheets for over 100 languages.



? Why not use the term Cheat Sheet?
A Leet Sheet is perhaps the most honest form of documentation one can make. To associate it with "Cheating", is not only inaccurate, but harmful. We need a great term for a great concept.
