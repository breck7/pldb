title	Where are the most programming languages created?					
subtitle	Every programming language was created in a country (or countries). C launched from the United States, Python from the Netherlands, and Ruby from Japan. At the moment, it appears the United States produces the most programming languagesâ€”more than all others combined, in fact. But PLDB is missing the `country` field for 3,780 languages. Perhaps when the dataset is a lot more complete the picture will look different. The data comes from https://pldb.io/languages.csv and is public domain and freely available. The chart was made with Our World In Data's Grapher which is open source software available at https://github.com/owid/owid-grapher
