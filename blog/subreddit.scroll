The 3 dominant platforms for programming language creators (r/ProgrammingLanguages, Lobsters, and HackerNews), all of which I helped grow initially, are all now heavily moderated and censored. As a result, I expect very few novel ideas to arise in those communities.

Thereforce I launched a new subreddit r/pldb, who's motto is very simple: An uncensored community about Programming Language design. No censorship for non-anon posters.
