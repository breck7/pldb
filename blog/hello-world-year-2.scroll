I started PLDB 1 year ago today! Since that time:
 dateline

- PLDB has gone from less than 400 languages to over 1,300! A 3x+ increase!
- PLDB has gone from less than 1GB to over 140GB of raw data! A 100x+ increase!
- PLDB has gone from tracking a few dozen dimensions to over 1,350! A 30x+ increase!

Unfortunately the number of articles on PLDB is 9  (counting this one). Limited time and resources has meant building up the dataset took priority. Hopefully the next year will see a lot of growth in number of posts!
